// ── spine/concurrency/consumer — THE BARGE-IN LOOP (12.1–12.4) ─────────────
//
// WHAT WAS BROKEN, RESTATED SO IT CANNOT BE RE-SHIPPED. 12.3's drain loop reads:
//
//     while (running) {
//         message = mailbox.take()          ← BLOCKS
//         ...
//         outcome  = await(inFlight)        ← loop-body indentation
//     }
//
// Under the ordinary reading of `await`, control never reaches `take()` while a
// turn is in flight. `turnInFlight` is therefore false at every `take()`, ALL
// THREE guards below it are dead code, and Fig 12.1's mid-turn "take Interrupt"
// is unproducible. The loop cannot conflate, cannot preempt, and cannot
// drain-join. It looks like a barge-in mailbox and is a serial queue.
//
// THE FIX IS ONE LINE OF SHAPE, NOT ONE LINE OF CODE: a SELECT over
// { the next message, the running turn's completion }. Kotlin has `select`;
// TypeScript has `Promise.race`. Because both arms are outstanding at once, a
// message is OBSERVABLE WHILE A TURN RUNS, which is the property every policy
// below depends on.
//
//   Input      per-source policy (12.2): conflate to the newest and FOLD A COUNT,
//              or queue durably, dedupe on a key and ack only after the commit.
//   Interrupt  PREEMPT: cancel, JOIN, then start — so two folds cannot interleave.
//   Drain      DEFER: never cancels. Wait, finalize, stop.
//
// ONE OUTSTANDING `take()` IS HELD ACROSS ITERATIONS. `Promise.race` discards
// the losers but does not cancel them, so a take() that lost must NOT be
// re-issued — that would consume and drop a message. Kotlin's `select` is atomic
// and needs no such bookkeeping; this is the one place the two ports differ in
// mechanism rather than in spelling.
//
// THERE IS A RUN-STATE HANDLE, AND DENYING IT IS WHAT MADE 12.3 UNIMPLEMENTABLE.
// Its safety does not come from being absent; it comes from SINGLE-CONSUMER
// OWNERSHIP: exactly one loop reads or writes it, so it is never shared and
// needs no lock. That is the difference between "no mutable state" (false) and
// "no *shared* mutable state" (true, and the whole point).
//
// THE TURN RUNNER IS INJECTED, NEVER IMPORTED. This folder does not name the
// agent-loop SDK; the SDK stays confined to `spine/agent/loop` (G3, C1).
// This folder also names no block and no composition root (C15).
//
// DISPATCHER CONFINEMENT. The consumer mints the turn's only channel into the
// system (`submit`) and calls the boundary itself. Both are synchronous and both
// run on the consumer's own single-threaded context, so the commit is serial by
// construction and two folds cannot interleave. Kotlin gets the same property
// from a single-threaded dispatcher the consumer owns. This one is structural
// rather than gate-checkable, and it is labelled as such.
//
// ACTOR CONFINEMENT is a different claim, and a checkable one. The turn's channel
// forwards to the boundary's AGENT channel; the consumer's own authored steps go
// to its SPINE channel; and a `FinishedStep` carries no Actor at all, so neither
// can be redirected by its payload.
