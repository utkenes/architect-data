// ── spine/pure/verb — one registration, two maps, default-deny by construction ─
// A Verb is everything a block declares about one tool: its name, the description
// the model reads, the input schema, the PURE body, the name→Command entry, and
// its reversibility.
//
// 14.3's default-deny becomes structural: there is no default. You pick a variant,
// and Irreversible CANNOT BE CONSTRUCTED without saying where its matching Request
// lives. Registering a tool FORCES the classification decision, and the
// classification is a reviewed row in the registry, not a guess.
//
// 6.8: there is exactly ONE tool mechanic. A presentation verb (focusTicket,
// setPanel) is a Verb with the same five properties, the same signer and the same
// blast radius as a domain verb (setPriority). There is no second table.
