# Model / tool version watch — XSPEC-357 AC-6.2
#
# The delta between "what a model does unaided" and "what UDS asks for" only moves when
# model capability moves. So the trend in integrations/verification/DELTA-TREND.md is
# refreshed on version change, not on a schedule: a monthly run in a month with no release
# measures nothing, and a routine that measures nothing is how a check quietly stops mattering.
#
# This script is the cheap half. It records the current versions and reports when one moved.
# Actually re-running the baselines is a separate, human-initiated job.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/watch-model-versions.sh          # report; exit 10 if a version changed
#   ./scripts/watch-model-versions.sh --update # report and record the new versions
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — nothing changed
#   10 — a version changed; DELTA-TREND.md is due a new data point
#   1  — could not determine a version (do NOT treat as "unchanged")

# The model behind the CLI matters more than the CLI itself, and it changes independently.
#
# Antigravity: `agy models` lists the models it OFFERS, not the one currently selected —
# a distinction worth stating rather than blurring. For this watch it is the right signal
# anyway: what has to be caught is Antigravity swapping the Gemini generation behind the
# CLI, and that shows up as the offered list changing. It is hashed rather than stored
# whole because the list is a dozen lines and a diff of it would drown the report.
#
# Until now only codex had a model probe, and the gap was recorded in XSPEC-357 AC-6.2 as
# "查 `agy` 有無等價的模型自報輸出（未查證，不要假設有）". Verified 2026-08-18: it does.
# The consequence of the gap was concrete — §4.9 measured the two sides moving in OPPOSITE
# directions (Codex 0/5 → 4/4, Antigravity 0/5 → 0/5), so a Gemini change with no CLI
# release would have moved the delta with nothing watching.

A capability change is the only thing that moves the delta, so this is when the trend is
worth re-measuring:

  1. Re-run each active probe's BASELINE only, in a scratch project with no UDS
     (see docs/reference/INTEGRATION-VERIFICATION.md §2.3)
  2. Record raw output under integrations/verification/_baselines/<tool>-<version>/
  3. Add a row to integrations/verification/DELTA-TREND.md

Before trusting a run: count tool calls. If the model read files, the answer says nothing
about what was loaded.
