// ── spine/pure/seams — the NAMED function seams ────────────────────────────
// A raw function type is an anonymous, transposable seam. `(S) -> TriageSlice` and
// `(S) -> Int` are different types by accident of their shape, while `(S) -> Slice`
// and any other one-argument reader are the SAME type — so nothing can implement one
// by name, no KDoc rides it, and a test double can only be a lambda. Naming the seam
// fixes all three and costs nothing at the call site: `operator fun invoke` keeps
// `lens(state)` reading as it did, and SAM conversion keeps `{ it.triage }` binding.
//
// These live in spine/pure because the spine declares the shapes and the blocks and
// the root supply them — the direction every other seam in this architecture points.
