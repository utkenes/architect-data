## Purpose

This standard defines the principles, workflows, and best practices for reverse engineering existing code into structured specification documents. Reverse engineering bridges legacy systems with modern development methodologies (SDD → BDD → TDD).

**Key Benefits**:
- Transform undocumented code into traceable specifications
- Enable modern development practices on legacy systems
- Create shared understanding between new team members and existing codebases
- Establish foundation for future enhancements and refactoring

### Workflow Stages

| Stage | Description | Output | Certainty Level |
|-------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Code Scanning** | Analyze code structure, APIs, data models | Technical inventory | [Confirmed] |
| **Test Analysis** | Parse existing tests for acceptance criteria | Draft acceptance criteria | [Confirmed]/[Inferred] |
| **Implicit Rule Scan** | Scan non-HTTP persistence write paths for undocumented rules | Implicit-rule inventory + three-question answers | [Confirmed]/[Inferred]/[Unknown] |
| **Gap Identification** | List unknowns requiring human input | Gap analysis document | [Unknown] items |
| **Spec Generation** | Generate draft specification | Draft SPEC-XXX.md | Mixed certainty |
| **Human Review** | Stakeholder validation and gap filling | Validated specification | [Confirmed] |

> **Note (v1.2.0)**: An **Implicit Rule Scan** stage is inserted after Code Scanning / Test Analysis and before Gap Identification — see [Implicit Rule Scan (Non-HTTP Persistence Rules)](#implicit-rule-scan-non-http-persistence-rules) below. Standard code scanning extracts HTTP entry points and data models, but persistent field values are frequently written by **non-HTTP paths** (cron, queue, computed columns, triggers, ORM hooks) whose business rules are never documented — the highest-frequency source of missed logic in a cross-language rewrite or cross-DB migration.

---

## Implicit Rule Scan (Non-HTTP Persistence Rules)

> **Workflow position**: after Code Scanning / Test Analysis, before Gap Identification.

Code scanning extracts what is reachable through HTTP — routes, controllers, request handlers. But a persisted field's value is often decided **off the request path**: a nightly cron flips a status, a queue retry re-stamps a timestamp, a database trigger derives a total, an ORM lifecycle hook zeroes a counter. Those rules are rarely written down, so a rewrite that only mirrors the HTTP surface silently drops them. This stage mechanically derives every non-HTTP write path and locks each implicit rule as a verifiable artifact.

### Derive (mechanical list source)

Scan the legacy system for every **non-HTTP persistence write path** across four categories:

1. **Scheduled** — crontab entries, scheduler config, `@Scheduled`-style annotations, batch jobs
2. **Queue** — queue consumers, job handlers, background workers, message listeners
3. **DB-layer** — triggers, computed/generated columns, `DEFAULT` expressions, check constraints
4. **ORM lifecycle** — `beforeSave`/`afterSave`/observer/model-event hooks, middleware that mutates persistent state

### Oracle (detect) — three questions per field

For each persistent field written by a non-HTTP path, answer and lock **three questions**:

| Question | What to capture |
|----------|-----------------|
| **When is it SET?** | The condition/trigger that first assigns the value |
| **When is it OVERWRITTEN?** | Every later write — **including asynchronous overwrites** (links back to post-cutover aggregate reconciliation) |
| **When is it RESET / zeroed?** | The conditions that clear or default the value back |

- Extend the **Devil's Advocate** challenge from the HTTP layer to **cover non-HTTP paths**: apply the same five adversarial categories (boundary, ordering, concurrency, failure/retry, null/default) to cron conditions, queue retries, computed columns, and trigger logic.
- Tag every extracted rule with a certainty level: `[Confirmed]` (with a `file:line` citation) / `[Inferred]` / `[Unknown]`. Every `[Unknown]` is handed to Gap Identification for a human — it is never guessed.
- **Output**: lock each implicit rule as a **behavior-snapshot scenario** or a **reconciliation invariant** (e.g. `SUM(cost) GROUP BY status` must hold across cutover), so the rule becomes a re-runnable oracle rather than prose.

### Gate timing

Pre-flight (planning). Any non-HTTP write field whose three questions are unanswered is marked `not_implemented` and **blocks cutover** — an undeclared implicit rule is treated as a known omission risk, not an acceptable gap.

### PHP-specific note: loose comparison / type juggling

When scanning PHP write paths, additionally flag **loose-comparison / type-juggling** dependencies: `==` comparisons, the truthy/falsy behavior of `"0"` / `""` / `null` / `0`, and automatic string-to-number coercion. These have no direct equivalent under a strongly-typed target (e.g. C#/.NET), so the implicit rule they encode is a high-frequency source of silently-dropped logic during a cross-language rewrite. Mark each such site `[Confirmed]` with `file:line` and lock the intended semantics as an explicit rule.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Certainty Framework

All extracted information MUST be tagged with certainty levels:

| Tag | Definition | Example |
|-----|------------|---------|
| `[Confirmed]` | Directly verified from code or tests | "POST /api/users endpoint at src/routes/users.ts:15" |
| `[Inferred]` | Logical deduction from observed patterns | "Likely uses dependency injection based on constructor pattern" |
| `[Assumption]` | Reasonable assumption needing verification | "Sessions probably expire after 24 hours based on typical patterns" |
| `[Unknown]` | Cannot determine from code, requires human input | "Business motivation for this feature" |

**Rule**: When in doubt, use a more uncertain tag rather than overclaiming.

### 2. Anti-Hallucination Compliance

This standard strictly follows [Anti-Hallucination Standards](anti-hallucination.md):

- **Evidence-Based**: Only analyze content that has been explicitly read
- **Source Attribution**: Every claim must include `[Source: Code]` or `[Source: Test]` with file:line references
- **No Fabrication**: Never invent APIs, configurations, or requirements without verification
- **Explicit Unknowns**: Always list what cannot be determined from code

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

Extract information in layers:

1. **System Overview**: Entry points, main components, high-level architecture
2. **Component Details**: Individual modules, their responsibilities, interfaces
3. **Implementation Specifics**: Algorithms, data flows, edge cases

### 4. Test-to-Requirement Mapping

Existing tests are valuable sources of implicit requirements:

```javascript
// Test: src/tests/auth.test.ts
describe('Authentication', () => {
  it('should return 401 for invalid credentials', () => {...});
  it('should issue JWT token on successful login', () => {...});
});
```

Maps to:

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria
[Confirmed] From test analysis (src/tests/auth.test.ts):
- [ ] Return 401 status code for invalid credentials (line 3)
- [ ] Issue JWT token on successful login (line 4)
```

## What Can vs Cannot Be Extracted

### Extractable (AI Automated)

| Aspect | Certainty | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| API Endpoints | [Confirmed] | Route definitions, controllers |
| Data Models | [Confirmed] | Types, interfaces, schemas |
| Function Signatures | [Confirmed] | Parameters, return types |
| Test Cases | [Confirmed] | Test files → Acceptance Criteria |
| Dependencies | [Confirmed] | Package references, imports |
| Configuration Patterns | [Confirmed] | Config files |
| Behavior Patterns | [Inferred] | Code analysis |

### Not Extractable (Requires Human Input)

| Aspect | Why | Required Action |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| **Motivation/Why** | Historical context not in code | Ask stakeholders |
| **Business Context** | Domain knowledge | Ask product owner |
| **Risk Assessment** | Requires domain expertise | Consult domain experts |
| **Trade-off Decisions** | Historical context missing | Review design docs if any |
| **Non-Functional Requirements** | Often implicit | Discuss with architects |
| **Out-of-Scope Decisions** | Explicitly excluded items | Review original requirements |

### SDD Integration

Reverse-engineered specifications feed directly into SDD workflow:

1. **Output = SDD Proposal Draft**: The generated specification becomes a proposal
2. **Human Review Required**: All `[Unknown]` sections MUST be filled by humans
3. **Formal Approval**: Spec must go through standard SDD review process
4. **Status Tracking**: Mark as "Reverse-Engineered" in spec metadata

### BDD Integration

Convert acceptance criteria to Gherkin format:

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria (from reverse engineering)
[Confirmed] User can add item to empty cart
[Confirmed] Quantity increments for duplicate items
[Inferred] Maximum quantity limit: 99 items
```

Becomes:

```gherkin
Feature: Shopping Cart
  # Source: Reverse-engineered from src/cart/

  Scenario: Add item to empty cart
    Given an empty shopping cart
    When the user adds "Widget" to the cart
    Then the cart should contain 1 "Widget"

  Scenario: Add duplicate item
    Given a cart with 1 "Widget"
    When the user adds another "Widget"
    Then the cart should contain 2 "Widget"

  @needs-confirmation
  Scenario: Maximum quantity limit
    Given a cart with 99 "Widget"
    When the user tries to add another "Widget"
    Then the add should be rejected
    # [Inferred] - Verify with stakeholders
```

### TDD Integration

Use reverse-engineered specifications to identify test coverage gaps:

1. **Map Existing Tests**: Link tests to acceptance criteria
2. **Identify Gaps**: Find criteria without corresponding tests
3. **Prioritize**: Focus on high-risk untested behaviors
4. **Write Tests**: Use TDD workflow for new test coverage

## Metadata
- **Status**: Draft (Reverse-Engineered)
- **Source**: [directory or file path]
- **Generated**: [date]
- **Reviewed By**: [pending]

## Summary
[Brief description - [Inferred] or [Confirmed]]

## Motivation
[Unknown] - Requires human input
- Why was this feature originally built?
- What problem does it solve?

## Technical Design

### API Endpoints
[Confirmed] From code analysis:
- `POST /api/resource` - [Source: Code] src/routes/resource.ts:15
- `GET /api/resource/:id` - [Source: Code] src/routes/resource.ts:25

### Data Models
[Confirmed] From type definitions:
- `Resource` interface - [Source: Code] src/types/resource.ts:5-20

### Dependencies
[Confirmed] From import analysis:
- Database: PostgreSQL (knex client)
- Cache: Redis

## Acceptance Criteria
[Confirmed] From test analysis (src/tests/resource.test.ts):
- [ ] Create resource with valid data (line 10)
- [ ] Return 400 for invalid input (line 25)
- [ ] Return 404 for non-existent resource (line 40)

[Unknown] Not covered by tests:
- [ ] [Need Confirmation] Rate limiting behavior
- [ ] [Need Confirmation] Cache invalidation strategy

## Risks
[Unknown] - Requires domain expertise

## Out of Scope
[Unknown] - Requires historical context

## Source Citations
| Item | File | Line | Certainty |
|------|------|------|-----------|
| POST /api/resource | src/routes/resource.ts | 15 | [Confirmed] |
| Resource interface | src/types/resource.ts | 5-20 | [Confirmed] |
| 400 on invalid | src/tests/resource.test.ts | 25 | [Confirmed] |
```

## Failure Handling & Escalation

Reverse engineering infers intent from existing code; some inputs cannot be
analyzed safely. This section defines the failure → escalate → re-verify path so
a low-confidence or unparseable input never produces a spec that looks
authoritative.

| Condition | Trigger | Action | Re-verify |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Parse failure** | Source cannot be parsed (unsupported language, broken syntax tree) | Mark the unit `[Unknown]` and report the language/file; escalate to a human domain expert. Emit no inferred behavior for it. | Source parses after tooling/fix |
| **High unknown ratio** | `[Unknown]` items exceed the confidence threshold (default > 50% of behaviors) | Halt spec finalization; require a subject-matter-expert interview to fill `[Unknown]` items first. Do not ship a majority-guessed spec. | Unknown ratio below threshold |
| **Contradicted inference** | Code contradicts a previously inferred behavior | Downgrade the item to `[Assumption]` and escalate to the code owner; never record a contradicted inference as `[Confirmed]`. | Owner confirms or corrects |
| **Test-analysis failure** | Existing tests cannot be run/parsed for behavior extraction | Fall back to static analysis only; mark affected behaviors `[Inferred]` (lower certainty), never `[Confirmed]`. | — |

**Rule RE-FAIL-001 (Required)**: A parse failure or an above-threshold
`[Unknown]` ratio MUST block spec finalization and escalate to a human — never
present a sub-threshold-confidence spec as authoritative.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Code Analysis Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Impact | Correct Approach |
|--------------|--------|------------------|
| **Fabricating Motivation** | Misleading spec | Mark as `[Unknown]` |
| **Assuming Requirements** | False confidence | Mark as `[Need Confirmation]` |
| **Speculating About Unread Code** | Hallucination | Only analyze what's read |
| **Presenting Inferences as Facts** | Broken trust | Always use appropriate tags |
| **Skipping Human Review** | Incomplete spec | Always require review phase |

### Process Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Impact | Correct Approach |
|--------------|--------|------------------|
| **Generating for Unread Code** | Invalid output | Read all relevant files first |
| **Filling [Unknown] Without Human** | Invalid spec | Always get human input |
| **Skipping Test Analysis** | Missing criteria | Always analyze existing tests |
| **Single-Pass Generation** | Shallow spec | Use progressive disclosure |

---

## Best Practices

### Do's

- ✅ Read all relevant files before making any claims
- ✅ Tag every statement with certainty level
- ✅ Include source citations with file:line references
- ✅ Clearly list what needs human input
- ✅ Preserve original code comments as context
- ✅ Map tests to acceptance criteria
- ✅ Use progressive disclosure (overview → details)
- ✅ Validate inferences with stakeholders

### Don'ts

- ❌ Assume motivation or business context
- ❌ Present inferences as confirmed facts
- ❌ Skip source attribution
- ❌ Generate specs for unread code
- ❌ Fill `[Unknown]` sections without human input
- ❌ Ignore existing tests
- ❌ Skip human review phase
- ❌ Over-engineer the specification
