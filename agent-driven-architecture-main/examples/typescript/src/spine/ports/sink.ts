// ── spine/ports/sink — the perform seam (G9) ────────────────────────────────
// INTERFACES ONLY (C11).
//
// `perform` accepts a KeyedEffect and NOTHING ELSE, so an effect can never
// cross this seam without the idempotency key 14.6 depends on.
//
//   LIVE      perform once, for real
//   REPLAY    collect the descriptor; TOUCH NOTHING
//   RECOVERY  re-drive un-acknowledged effects; the sink dedupes on the key
//
// REPLAY and RECOVERY are constructed and tested, not merely declared — the
// shipped reference declared REPLAY in both ports and constructed it nowhere.
