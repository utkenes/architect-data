// ── eslint.config.js — THE GATE (15.2) ─────────────────────────────────────
// 15.1 stakes the architecture's answer to its own central problem on machine
// enforcement, and 15.4 closes: "the payoff … is contingent on these checks
// being present and blocking." The shipped reference shipped NONE — `Date.now()`
// inside a tool body and an `fs` import in the domain file both compiled clean,
// 8/8 green, no CI, no lint config, no rule of any kind.
//
// Seventeen checks. FIFTEEN LIVE HERE, in ordinary ESLint rules that any
// TypeScript team already runs; C13 (registry totality plus handler totality)
// and C17 (no Irreversible-class effect constructed outside its pinned site) are
// vitest checks,
// because each is a question about VALUES or about the TREE, not about one
// file's syntax. All seventeen DENY — `npm
// run lint` exits non-zero — and every one ships a BLOCK-test and an ALLOW-test
// (test/gate/gate.test.ts over test/gate/fixtures/). There is no warning tier.
//
// Boring on purpose: `no-restricted-imports` with an allow-list regex per
// folder is §1.3's import table written out verbatim, `no-restricted-syntax` is
// the forbidden-call list, and exhaustiveness is the type-aware
// `switch-exhaustiveness-check`. Nothing here is a bespoke analyser, so a
// reader can check the rule against the ESLint docs rather than against us.
//
// Discipline (15.2): a wrong rule is FIXED and re-tested, never disabled. No
// check ships without its allow-test — that is what keeps a check from drifting
// into a nuisance authors turn off.

//
// The two spellings are not interchangeable and the split is deliberate. A bare
// specifier is resolved through the target package's `exports` map, so an
// unpublished path is a resolution error before any rule runs; a relative path
// is resolved against `rootDir`, so it is a resolution error only when it
// escapes into a project this one does not reference. Neither mechanism can say
// WHICH tier of a referenced package a folder may name — that is this table's
// job, and it is the reason the table outlives the wall.

/** C1 — THE RULE, in the book's canonical wording, verbatim: an import may
 *  point inward toward the core, or it is the composition root; it may never
 *  point outward from the core, sideways between adapters, or from a passive
 *  node — a surface or a tool — into anything but domain types.
 *  §1.3 is that sentence as an ALLOW-LIST, so anything not listed is forbidden.
 *
 *  SUNSET — `spine-2`, marked 2026-07-30. The workspace wall ships at `spine-1`
 *  and this check is deleted at the next spine revision. THE TRIGGER IS NAMED IN
 *  THE ONE IDENTIFIER THIS REPOSITORY CAN PRODUCE: a review found this schedule
 *  written as a semantic version nine times over, and the release check accepts
 *  only `spine-<n>` headings — so the promised deletion could never fire, and a
 *  sunset whose trigger cannot occur is a comment, not a plan. MEASURED, so the deletion is a
 *  decision and not a surprise: of the NINETEEN allow-list sites in this file
 *  the package boundary subsumes ZERO. Ten are INTRA-SPINE-TIER (`spine/pure`
 *  may not import `spine/ports`) and the spine is one package, so no package
 *  edge exists to express them. Eight are INTRA-BLOCK PER-FILE (only `tools.ts`
 *  gets the schema DSL, only the ADAPTER LEAF gets a client library, only a
 *  `*.test.ts` resident gets the shared rig) and npm cannot scope a dependency
 *  below package granularity — the same limitation the Kotlin port names for
 *  Gradle. The adapter clause is the one that moved: the leaf is now its own
 *  package, so WHERE the client library may live is a manifest fact and the pure
 *  unit's dependency list omits it. What did NOT move is who can RESOLVE one —
 *  npm hoists a single copy to the one root store, so a bare third-party name
 *  still resolves from any file the root reaches, and this line is what denies
 *  it. That is the same measurement test/laws/edges.test.ts pins as a negative
 *  wall, and it is why the site count is still eight. One is the catch-all, which the wall does subsume in part. What the
 *  wall adds is a SECOND, earlier layer on the cross-package fragment; what it
 *  cannot do is carry this table. Deleting this check on schedule therefore
 *  means moving those eighteen sites onto a layer that does not exist yet, and
 *  that layer is the release's work, not this file's.
 *
 *  The count is one `only(…)` call per bucket with an allow-list: ten spine
 *  buckets, eight inside a block folder (four of which share the `blockImports`
 *  helper), and the catch-all. `app` has no allow-list, which is what makes it
 *  the composition root.
 *
 *  (The old spelling carried a `v` prefix on purpose: an unprefixed
 *  three-component numeral on a comment line is read by the citation lint's
 *  STRICT position as a book section and reported as a phantom one. The
 *  `spine-<n>` identifier has no such collision.) */

// C2 — G11: no cross-block symbol import. From inside `blocks/X`, a sibling is
// exactly one `../` away, any `../../blocks/…` is the long way round to the same
// place, and since the wall `@adr/block-…` is the third way. Blocks communicate
// by reading a sibling's slice off the one folded State as a VALUE, or by
// dispatching a verb the sibling's arm folds.
//
// SUNSET — `spine-2`, marked 2026-07-30, AND THE ONE ROUTE THE WALL LEAVES OPEN.
// Five cross-block routes were measured against a standing workspace, `tsc -b`
// exit code and error code each recorded in this port's README:
//   · `../escalation/fold`             — denied, TS6059 + TS6307 (rootDir)
//   · `@adr/block-escalation/fold`     — denied, TS2307 (unpublished subpath)
//   · `@adr/block-escalation/adapter`  — denied, TS2307 (unpublished subpath)
//   · `@adr/block-escalation`          — denied, TS2307 (no `.` export)
//   · `@adr/block-escalation/register` — RESOLVES CLEAN, exit 0
// The fifth is this rule's whole subject. npm links every workspace package into
// the single root node_modules, and neither an exports map nor a tsconfig
// reference can make a package's PUBLISHED entry visible to one consumer and
// invisible to another. So the wall narrows this route from "any file in the
// sibling" to "the sibling's one declared entry" and cannot close it. The third
// pattern below is what closes it, and the release that deletes this rule owes
// that route a replacement layer.

// C4, fourth half — ONE PRODUCTION SITE FOR THE STAMP, in THREE layers.
// The Kotlin port denies the resolved call `adr.spine.pure.Signature.<init>` in

// TypeScript has no module-internal visibility, so the analogue denies the
// VALUE BINDING instead: `Signature` is a CLASS, and a file that can only name
// it as a TYPE cannot construct one at all — `new Signature(…)` against a
// type-only import is a compile error, aliased or not.
//
// C4_MINT is ONE `no-restricted-imports` entry, deliberately not a set of
// esquery selectors. MEASURED: this single entry denies the named import, the
// aliased import, the inline-`type`-mixed import, the namespace import and the
// re-export, at ANY specifier spelling — including the `.js` suffix and any
// future rename of `actor.ts`, both of which defeated the path-keyed selectors
// this replaced. `allowTypeImports` keeps every `import type` fold arm and
// every `export type` register.ts clean. It is also this file's own idiom (C4,
// C5_MINT, C7_IMPORT all ride `importNames`), so it EXTENDS the owner rather
// than planting a rival detector at the same layer.
//
// THE ASYMMETRY IS THE POINT, and it is what closes the two-hop:

//   C4_LAUNDER rides EVERY bucket, boundary included — a second module
//             republishing the constructor puts it back within reach under a
//             name an import rule cannot key on.
//   C4_SEAL   rides the minting bucket ONLY, and is the price of the
//             exemption: the one folder that holds a value binding of
//             `Signature` publishes NO value binding at all, because
//             `import { Signature as S }; export { S }` rebinds the name and a

// NAMED RESIDUE, in the C4_SHAPE tradition of writing down what a rule cannot
// see. These three layers close STATIC ESM VALUE BINDINGS of the name, and
// nothing else:
//   · an explicit assertion (`{} as Signature`) or an `any` still produces a
//     value the type system accepts. It can no longer ride a Command — the
//     boundary refuses a Command whose stamp is not the one this step minted
//     (spine/boundary/action.ts) — but no rule here denies writing it.
//   · `boundary.ts` could wrap `new Signature(…)` in an exported function. That
//     is not a re-export and no selector sees it; it is a one-file diff inside
//     the one folder whose whole job is minting, and the runtime identity check
//     is what makes it non-load-bearing.

// SCOPED TO THE MINT BUCKETS, and that is what makes a blanket form denial
// affordable: `C7_MINT` already denies binding the mint anywhere else, so a
// value binding of it can only exist in these two folders. Riding every bucket
// instead was MEASURED and rejected — it reddens `src/blocks/artifact/fold.ts`
// and `project.ts`, where `seal` is live block domain vocabulary
