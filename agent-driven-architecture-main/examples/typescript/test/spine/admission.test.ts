// ── ADMISSION — the refusal is a property of the DERIVATION, not of LIVE ──
//
// docs/DECISIONS.md:85 says the boundary refuses an irreversible effect before
// perform. Written ONLY at the boundary that is a property of the LIVE path, and
// a recovery re-drive derives its own effect sequence from the committed
// results — so a rule the live path applies and the re-derivation does not is a
// rule that pages on-call again on restart. Every probe below drives a session
// in which the refusal actually fires, then asserts that the LIVE sink,
// `refold`, `collectPerform` in RECOVERY and `refoldFrom` all agree.
//
// THE PROBE HAS TO BE BUILT, and that is a MEASUREMENT of the shipped reference
// rather than a weakness of the rule. Only two verbs are registered
// `Irreversible` (`confirmEscalation`, `confirmSeal`) and the only two
// `Irreversible`-class effects (`PageOncall`, `DeliverArtifact`) are emitted
// exclusively from their own arms — check C17 now denies any other construction
// site outright — so admission refuses NOTHING on the shipped app: it is a
// floor, and a floor nobody stands on is invisible. The rig below therefore
// installs a fold that DOES the wrong thing, because a probe whose session never
// produces a refused effect passes every arrangement of the code and proves
// nothing at all.
//
// TWO ROGUE ATTRIBUTIONS, for the two clauses of the rule:
//   · a page attributed to an OK `setPriority`      — a Reversible verb has no
//     licence, and its neighbour's licence is not transferable (PER EFFECT);
//   · a page attributed to a GATE-REFUSED `confirmEscalation` — the verb IS
//     Irreversible and the result did NOT survive (the `ok` clause), which is
//     the headline failure of docs/DECISIONS.md:85 and the one clause no other
//     probe can see.
