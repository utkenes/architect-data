 * THE TEST DRIVER, as a constructed type.

 * These four were top-level extensions on App. Test sources are in scope for the law
 * (no-loose-top-level-fun ignores build/, node_modules/, dist/ and *.gradle.kts, and
 * nothing else), and deliberately so: an untestable helper is not excused by living
 * next to the tests, and an extension is the least substitutable shape there is —
 * static dispatch, no instance, no override.
