/**
 * THE READINESS MATRIX — the PRESENT tense of declare-then-earn (concept #959).
 *
 *   bun dev/matrix.ts <matrix.toml> <command> [args]
 *
 * Three planes run over this build:
 *   dev/manifests/*.toml   FUTURE  — units declared as data before implementation. A referenced-
 *                                    but-missing unit is mechanically visible, never remembered.
 *   dev/matrix.toml        PRESENT — one row per unit: what is proven, and by which artifact.
 *   dev/campaigns/*.toml   PAST/WORK — the campaign backlog and its construction diary.
 *
 * A gate sits between each tense: the future cannot pretend to be present, and the present cannot
 * rewrite the past.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED IS THE ENTIRE POINT. `ready` requires a host proof, and `verified` is not a rung
 * anyone sets at all: it is DERIVED at query time — every recorded edge still resolving in the
 * current tree, the latest completed ci run on main green and having tested what main currently
 * is, a review pointer present. Without that rule this is a checklist, and a checklist is
 * something an agent can tick. With it, the matrix is an INPUT the build reads — consumers gate
 * on row status, so an unproven capability stays invisible at runtime and a claim not derived
 * from an earned row cannot ship. You cannot lie to it, which is what makes it worth keeping.

# A row derives verified ⟺ it is ready AND every recorded edge (path+token) still resolves in the
# CURRENT tree AND the latest completed ci run on main is green AND that run tested what main
# currently is AND a review pointer is present and shape-valid. Nothing sha-shaped is stored: the
