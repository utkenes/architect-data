// ── spine/pure/tool-result — the sealed ROOT of every tool payload ─────────
// The parent declares `tool` ONCE, so every variant that will ever exist carries
// its verb name by construction (G12). The name is the discriminant of ToolResult,
// of Command, and the key of the registry — one name per verb (6.8), which is what
// makes 17.6's "the gate keys off names" literally true.
//
// PACKAGE NOTE (G12, in Kotlin): Kotlin requires every variant of a sealed hierarchy to be
// declared in the same package and module. Blocks contribute cases, so every
// transport declaration in the system — this file, Command.kt, Effect.kt and each
// block's Contract.kt — shares the package `adr.contract` while staying in its own
// folder. That is a documented consequence of G12 plus Kotlin, not an accident;
// gate check C2 compensates by denying cross-block symbols by name prefix.
//
// HARD CONSTRAINT (G1): no ToolResult variant has a field of type Actor,
// Authority or Signature, and none may gain one. A tool asking "who is asking?"
// is asking the wrong question — the answer is stamped after it returns.
