// ── blocks/escalation/slice — a sealed status set, used FULLY (G12) ────────
// `TicketStatus` is the worked instance of G12's central instruction: declare
// shared properties on the sealed parent so every variant carries them BY
// CONSTRUCTION. Two properties earn their place there:
//
//   ticket         every status is about a ticket; no variant may forget it
//   requestedBy    the authority whose Request is still pending confirmation,
//                  or null. This is what the boundary gate compares against —
//                  and because it is declared on the PARENT, a fifth variant
//                  cannot be added without answering "is a request pending?".
//                  That answer costs the gate ZERO consumer sites: adding
//                  `Archived` breaks the fold arm, the view row and the context
//                  line, and nothing else in the system.
//
// The variant list is closed here and consumed with `never`-guarded switches in
// `fold.ts` and `project.ts` — the three sites 15.4's G12 self-check promises,
// all inside this one folder.
