// ── spine/agent/loop — the loop is a DECLARATION (G3) ──────────────────
// The ONLY file in the system that imports the agent-loop runtime (the Vercel
// AI SDK). It converts the registry's verb table into SDK tools and hooks the
// boundary onto `onStepFinish` — that callback IS the boundary seam. There is
// no domain logic here, no branching, and no state (check C14).
//
// IT FORWARDS ACTIONS, NOT RESULTS (G1/§3.1). The SDK's serialized tool output
// never reaches the fold; what reaches the fold is what `resolveAction`
// produced from the model's RAW input. That makes `resolveAction` the single
// production site of every ToolResult in the system, so a recorded result can
// never disagree with what the boundary folded.
//
// PRICE, STATED PLAINLY: the pure tool body runs TWICE per agent action — once
// in `execute` so the model gets a payload-rich result to reason over, once at
// the boundary to produce the recorded truth. A pure function evaluated twice
// is free, and that is the price of one production site. (See the matching
// comment at the second call site in `spine/boundary/action.ts`.)
