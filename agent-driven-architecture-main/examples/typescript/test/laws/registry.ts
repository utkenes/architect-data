// ── laws.toml, READ AND JUDGED — the gate for the law registry ────────────
//
// `laws.toml` is the one source of truth for the sixteen portable invariants:
// id, invariant name, the layer that actually holds each law, and the checks
// (with their fixture pairs) that do the holding. The book's §15.3 table is
// then ASSERTED against it rather than hand-maintained beside it.
//
// Three deliberate choices, all stated so a reader can attack them:
//
//   · NO TOML LIBRARY. Neither port carries a TOML parser and adding a
//     dependency to read one checked-in file is a poor trade, so `laws.toml` is
//     held to a deliberately trivial grammar — full-line comments, `[[laws]]`
//     and `[[laws.checks]]` headers, `key = "basic string"`, `key = ["a","b"]` —
//     and the reader below is that grammar and nothing else. Anything outside
//     it is a REPORTED problem, never silently skipped: a reader that shrugs at
//     a line it does not understand is a registry that can be edited past.
//
//   · POINTERS ARE RESOLVED, NEVER TRUSTED. A fixture pointer that is only a
//     string has C7's failure mode exactly (a rule whose fixtures no longer
//     stand for the tree, green forever). Every on-disk pointer is resolved and
//     required to be a NON-EMPTY file or directory. THE VALUE-CHECK SHAPE IS
//     HELD TO THE SAME BAR. A check whose block/allow pair is two inputs to one
//     checker has no tree to point at, and the field pair that would have
//     pointed at one was required EMPTY — so the registry proved nothing about
//     it, and the next value check could declare the shape, ship no block-test
//     at all, and pass. An in-checker row therefore NAMES its two test sites,
//     `<path>::<test title>`, and each is RESOLVED: the runner must be willing
//     to open the file, the file must still DECLARE a case under that exact
//     title in live code, that declaration must not be switched off, and the
//     two halves must be two different inputs rather than one named twice.
//
//   · OWNERSHIP IS DERIVED, NEVER DECLARED. Which checks a linter owns is read
//     out of the linter's own source by the caller and passed in as
//     `lintOwned`. A registry that asked THIS FILE whether a check is
//     lint-enforced would be asking the forger: flipping one token would let a
//     live lint rule shed its fixture pair with every gate still green.
