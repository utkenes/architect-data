/**
 * EXTERNAL WITNESS for the ledger and matrix CLIs — and it now actually covers both.
 *
 * Both carry their own `selftest` subcommand, which means weakening a check AND editing the test
 * that would have caught it is ONE coherent commit with no outside observer. The corpus catches
 * wall behaviour; it cannot catch a ledger CLI that quietly stops preserving comments — and
 * comment preservation is the property the entire memory model rests on.
 *
 * This file is that observer, and it lives in the guarded gates directory so it inherits the same
 * protection `ratchet-selftest.ts` gave the ratchet. It deliberately does NOT call the CLIs'
 * built-in selftests: re-running the test a file ships with proves only that the file agrees with
 * itself. It asserts the load-bearing PROPERTIES directly, against a throwaway ledger in /tmp.
 *
 * Only the properties whose loss would be silent. This is not a second test suite.
