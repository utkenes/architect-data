**Version**: 6.7.5 | **Released**: 2026-08-18 | **License**: [Dual License](LICENSE) (CC BY 4.0 + MIT)

Language-agnostic, framework-agnostic development standards for software projects. Ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability across diverse technology stacks with AI-native workflows.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install via npm (Recommended)

```bash
# Install globally (stable)
npm install -g universal-dev-standards

# Initialize your project
uds init
```

> Looking for beta or RC versions? See [Pre-release Versions](docs/PRE-RELEASE.md).

### Or use npx (No installation required)

```bash
npx universal-dev-standards init
```

> **Note**: Copying standards alone won't enable AI assistance. Use `uds init` to automatically configure your AI tool or manually reference standards in your tool's configuration file.

## 🏗️ Architecture

UDS content is organised along **two independent axes**. They answer different questions, and
conflating them is the most common way to misread the layout — so they are stated separately.

### Axis 1 — Depth: how much must always be loaded

This axis is a **behavioural contract**: it tells an AI agent what to read up front and what to
leave until asked. It is the axis that matters for context cost.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[AI Agent / Developer] --> R["<b>Rules</b><br/>core/*.md<br/><b>Always Read</b>"]
    R -- "needs explanation or a worked example" --> G["<b>Guides</b><br/>core/guides/*.md<br/>Read on Demand Only"]
    R -- "needs a full methodology (TDD, BDD, …)" --> M["<b>Methodologies</b><br/>methodologies/guides/*.md<br/>Read on Demand Only"]
```

| Layer | Location | Contains | AI behaviour |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rules** | `core/*.md` | Actionable rules, checklists, thresholds | **Always Read** |
| **Guides** | `core/guides/*.md` | Explanations, tutorials, examples | Read on Demand Only |
| **Methodologies** | `methodologies/guides/*.md` | Full methodology guides | Read on Demand Only |

### Axis 2 — Format: how the same standard is encoded

This axis carries **no depth claim**. A standard's `.ai.yaml` and `.md` forms are two encodings
of the same material, chosen by who is reading.

| Aspect | `ai/standards/*.ai.yaml` | `core/*.md` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Encoding** | Structured YAML | Prose Markdown |
| **Best for** | Deterministic machine lookup | Human reading and review |
| **Relative size** | ~69% of the Markdown form — a reformat, not a compaction tier<sup>†</sup> | baseline |

<sup>†</sup> Measured 2026-07-23 across the 135 standards that have both forms: 872,380 bytes of
YAML against 1,271,471 bytes of Markdown. Reproduce with the commands in
[Content Architecture §7](docs/reference/CONTENT-ARCHITECTURE.md#7-how-to-re-measure).

> 📐 The depth contract, where it is enforced across integrations, and the measured gap between
> the contract and the current tree are documented in
> **[docs/reference/CONTENT-ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/reference/CONTENT-ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## 🤖 AI Tool Support

UDS ships integrations for **11 live tools. 1 of them is behaviourally verified.**

Those are two different numbers on purpose. **Status** says how complete the integration
*we wrote* is. **Verified** says whether anyone has confirmed the tool actually reads it and
behaves accordingly — by running probes and recording the output. Until today the second
question had never been asked, so no answer to it can be assumed. See
[XSPEC-357](https://github.com/AsiaOstrich/dev-platform) for the probe design and the
verification queue (Antigravity → Codex → Claude Code → the rest).

| AI Tool | Status | Verified | Skills | Slash Commands | Configuration |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Claude Code** | ✅ Complete | 🔬 —<sup>◆</sup> | **55** | **51** | `CLAUDE.md` |

| **Google Antigravity** | ⚠️ Minimal | 🔬 — | —<sup>‡</sup> | — | `.antigravity/rules.md` |
| **Gemini CLI** | ⛔ Discontinued<sup>†</sup> | — | — | — | `GEMINI.md` (frozen) |

> **Status Legend** (how complete the integration we wrote is):
> ✅ Complete | 🔶 Partial | ⚠️ Minimal | ⏳ Planned | ⛔ Discontinued
>
> **Verified Legend** (whether a probe run confirmed the tool behaves accordingly):
> ✅ *date* verified | 🔬 — not yet verified | ⌛ expired | ❌ failed

<sup>◆</sup> Claude Code is in daily production use by the maintainer, which is why the
integration is the most complete — but **daily use is not a recorded verification**, and a
tool cannot be the judge of itself. It sits in the queue like everything else.

<sup>†</sup> Google sunset Gemini CLI on **2026-06-18** (announced at I/O 2026-05-19, 30-day
migration window), succeeded by Antigravity CLI. The `integrations/gemini-cli/` and `.gemini/`
trees are **frozen** — kept for reference, excluded from sync checks, and no longer maintained.
See [`.gemini/DEPRECATED.md`](.gemini/DEPRECATED.md).

<sup>‡</sup> Antigravity supports skills, but the correct install path is **not yet verified**
against a real Antigravity CLI. Two candidates conflict: `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/plugins/<name>/skills/`
(official plugin docs) and `.agent/skills/` (UDS's own 2026-02 spec, written in the Gemini CLI era).
`uds init` therefore does **not** install skills for this target until one is confirmed — an
unverified path fails silently, which is worse than not installing.
