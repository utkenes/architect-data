/**
 * Shipped dependency resolution integrity. // implements XSPEC-366 R1
 *
 * **The problem this measures.** A published npm package does not carry its
 * lockfile. Your CI tests the versions `package-lock.json` pins; whoever
 * installs the package gets whatever the declared ranges resolve to at their
 * install time. When those two differ, the entire test suite is green about a
 * combination nobody installs — and that green is indistinguishable from a
 * real one.
 *
 * **Who "whoever" is depends on how the project ships, and this module cannot
 * know that.** For a published package it is every consumer. For a product
 * distributed as a container image built with `npm ci`, its users get the
 * pinned column exactly, and the resolved column is instead what the next
 * lockfile regeneration will pull in — unreviewed, whenever someone happens to
 * run it. Both are worth knowing; neither is safe to assert as the other. The
 * report says both rather than picking one, and labels the column `resolves=`
 * for the same reason.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical. `engramgraph` declared
 * `"tree-sitter-c-sharp": "^0.23.1"`. Three published versions satisfy that
 * range and they do not share an API: 0.23.1 exports `nodeTypeInfo`, 0.23.5
 * does not. npm resolves a caret to the newest match, so every fresh install
 * received the incompatible one and **no C# file ever parsed for anyone who
 * installed from npm** — while the lockfile pinned the working version and
 * every test passed. See XSPEC-365 / XSPEC-366.
 *
 * ## Three design choices worth knowing
 *
 * **Only `dependencies` and `optionalDependencies` are examined.**
 * `devDependencies` are not installed by consumers, so a drift there cannot
 * reach them.
 *
 * **Resolution goes through `npm view`, not a hand-rolled registry fetch.**
 * The question being asked is "what would resolve *in this environment*", and
 * `npm view` honours the local npm configuration — private registries, scoped
 * registries, auth, proxies. A direct fetch of registry.npmjs.org would
 * silently answer a different question for anyone who does not install from
 * the public registry, and would answer it confidently.
 *
 * **And it applies npm's resolution rule, not semver's.** The highest version
 * satisfying a range is *not* what npm installs: npm prefers the `latest`
 * dist-tag whenever it satisfies, so a `next` or `beta` publish carrying an
 * ordinary version number does not land on people. Getting this wrong made the
 * tool name a version no consumer receives — see `resolveViaNpm`.
 *
 * **A registry lookup that fails is never folded into "consistent".** It
 * becomes `unverifiable` and makes the whole check non-zero. A tool whose
 * "everything is fine" and "I could not find out" look the same is worse than
 * no tool: it converts an unknown into a reassurance.
 *
 * ## Native dependencies are held to a stricter rule (XSPEC-366 R2)
 *
 * A package with a native binding is flagged when its declared version is a
 * range rather than an exact version — **even when it is not currently
 * drifting**. That is not general dependency hygiene, it is a response to
 * measured behaviour: the tree-sitter ecosystem has broken ABI inside a minor
 * range, and semver makes no promise about native ABI compatibility.
 *
 * The distinction matters because "not drifting" is a fact about today. Four
 * tree-sitter ranges in one AsiaOstrich project currently match exactly one
 * published version each, so nothing drifts — while the range that caused the
 * incident next door matched two. They are safe because upstream has not
 * published again, not because anything guarantees it, and waiting for drift
 * means waiting until users already have it.

 * **This deliberately reproduces npm's rule, not semver's.** The obvious
 * implementation — take the highest published version satisfying the range —
 * is wrong, and wrong in the direction this module exists to catch. npm's
 * resolver (`npm-pick-manifest`) prefers the `latest` dist-tag whenever it
 * satisfies the range, and only falls back to the maximum otherwise. That rule
 * exists so a `next` or `beta` publish does not land on people who asked for a
 * caret.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-07: `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` published
 * `latest = 0.3.223` and `next = 0.3.224`, both ordinary semver strings, both
 * satisfying `^0.3`. The maximum-satisfying rule named 0.3.224;
 * `npm install @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk@^0.3` installs 0.3.223. **The
 * earlier implementation reported a version no consumer receives** — in the one
 * column whose entire purpose is to say what they receive.
 *
 * Versions and tags are read in a single `npm view` call. The version list is
 * in publish order, **not** semver order — a backport released after a major
 * bump appears last while being the lowest version — so the fallback maximum is
 * computed with semver rather than by taking the final element.
