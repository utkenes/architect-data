|Intro|.3  Network Protocols
------------------------------------------

Network architectures prescribe and describe a particular modularization
of the network. The challenge is to identify the collection of modules
that simultaneously provide a service that is useful in a large number
of situations, and can be efficiently implemented in the underlying
system. This is exactly what the two architectures introduced in the
previous section try to do, but before we get into the merits and
limitations of any particular architecture, let's first consider what
these "network modules" actually look like.

|Intro|.3.1 Layering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Abstractions naturally lead to layering, especially in network
systems.  The general idea is that you start with the services offered
by the underlying hardware and then add a sequence of layers, each
providing a higher (more abstract) level of service. The services
provided at the high layers are implemented using the services
provided by the low layers.

Using the Internet architecture as an example, we can imagine a simple
design with two layers of abstraction sandwiched between the
application program and the underlying network hardware, as
illustrated in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-layers>`. The layer immediately
above the hardware provides host-to-host connectivity, abstracting
away the fact that there may be an arbitrarily complex network
topology between any two hosts. (This is what IP is designed to do in
the Internet architecture.) The next layer up builds on the available
host-to-host message delivery service and provides support for
process-to-process communication channels, abstracting away the
possibility that the underlying network occasionally loses or reorders
messages. (This is what TCP and UDP are designed to do in the Internet
architecture.)

   Example of a layered network system.

Layering provides two useful features. First, it decomposes the
problem of building a network into more manageable components. Rather
than implementing a monolithic piece of software that does everything
you will ever want, you can implement several layers, each of which
solves one part of the problem. Second, if you decide that you want to
add some new service, you may only need to modify the functionality at
one layer, reusing the functions provided at all the other layers.

Thinking of a system as a linear sequence of layers is an
oversimplification, however. Many times there are multiple
abstractions provided at any given level of the system, each providing
a different service to the higher layers, but building on the same
low-level abstractions. We saw this in the Internet architecture
depicted in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-internet>`, where TCP and UDP
offer two different process-to-process communication services, one
establishing a reliable byte-stream between two processes (TCP) and
the other delivering unreliable datagrams between two processes (UDP).


|Intro|.3.2 Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a set of layers as a foundation, we are now ready to discuss the
modularization of a network more precisely. For starters, the abstract
objects that make up the layers of a network system are called
*protocols*. That is, a protocol provides a communication service that
higher-level objects (such as application processes, or perhaps
higher-level protocols) use to exchange messages. TCP, UDP, and IP are
all examples of Internet protocols.

Each protocol defines two different interfaces. First, it defines a
*service interface* to the other objects on the same computer that
want to use its communication services. This service interface defines
the operations that local objects can perform on the protocol. For
example, the TCP protocol supports operations by which an application
can send and receive messages. An implementation of the HTTP protocol,
for example, could support an operation to fetch a page of hypertext
from a remote server. An application such as a web browser would
invoke such an operation whenever the browser needs to obtain a new
page (e.g., when the user clicks on a link in the currently displayed
page).

Second, a protocol defines a *peer interface* to its counterpart
(peer) on another machine. This second interface defines the form and
meaning of messages exchanged between protocol peers to implement the
communication service. This would determine the way in which a
protocol on one machine communicates with its peer on another
machine. In the case of HTTP, for example, the protocol specification
defines in detail how a *GET* command is formatted, what arguments can
be used with the command, and how a web server should respond when it
receives such a command.

To summarize, a protocol defines a communication service that it exports
locally (the service interface), along with a set of rules governing the
messages that the protocol exchanges with its peer(s) to implement this
service (the peer interface). This situation is illustrated in :numref:`Figure
%s <fig-interfaces>`.

.. _fig-interfaces:
.. figure:: introduction/figures/interfaces.png

   :align: center

   Service interfaces and peer interfaces.

At the lowest hardware level, peers directly communicate with each
other over a physical medium. At every level above that, however,
peer-to-peer communication is indirect—each protocol communicates with
its peer by passing messages to some lower-level protocol, which in
turn delivers the message to *its* peer. And because there are
potentially multiple protocols at any given level, each providing a
different communication service, we represent the suite of protocols
that make up a network system with a *protocol graph*. The nodes of
the graph correspond to protocols, and the edges represent a *depends
on* relation. For example, :numref:`Figure %s <fig-protograph>`
illustrates a protocol graph for our Internet-inspired layered system.

.. _fig-protograph:
.. figure:: introduction/figures/protograph.png
   :width: 500px
   :align: center

   Example of a protocol graph.

In this example, suppose that the file transfer program on host 1
wants to send a message to its peer on host 2 using the communication
service offered by UDP; the Internet has such a program, called TFTP.
In this case, the file application asks UDP to send the message on its
behalf. To communicate with its peer, UDP invokes the services of IP,
which invokes the services of ETH, which in turn transmits the message
to its peer on the other machine. Once the message has arrived at the
instance of IP on host 2, IP passes the message up to UDP, which in
turn delivers the message to the application. In this particular case,
the application is said to employ the services of the UDP/IP/ETH
*protocol stack*.

Note that the term *protocol* is used in two different ways. Sometimes
it refers to the abstract interfaces—that is, the operations defined
by the service interface and the form and meaning of messages
exchanged between peers, and sometimes it refers to the module that
actually implements these two interfaces. To distinguish between the
interfaces and the module that implements these interfaces, we can
refer to the former as a *protocol specification*. Specifications are
generally expressed using a combination of prose, pseudocode, state
transition diagrams, pictures of packet formats, and other abstract
notations. It should be the case that a given protocol can be
implemented in different ways by different programmers, as long as
each adheres to the specification. The challenge is ensuring that two
different implementations of the same specification can successfully
exchange messages. Two or more protocol modules that do accurately
implement a protocol specification are said to *interoperate* with
each other.

|Intro|.3.3 Encapsulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider what happens in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-protograph>` when one
of the application programs sends a message to its peer by passing the
message to UDP. From UDP’s perspective, the message it is given by the
application is an uninterpreted string of bytes. UDP does not care
that these bytes represent an array of integers, an email message, a
digital image, or whatever; it is simply charged with sending them to
its peer.  However, UDP must communicate control information to its
peer, instructing it how to handle the message when it is received.
UDP does this by attaching a *header* to the message.

A header is a small data structure—from a few bytes to a few dozen
bytes—that is used among peers to communicate with each other. As the
name suggests, headers are usually attached to the front of a
message. In some cases, however, this peer-to-peer control information
is sent at the end of the message, in which case it is called a
*trailer*. The exact format for the header attached by UDP is defined
by its protocol specification. The rest of the message—that is, the
data being transmitted on behalf of the application—is called the
message’s *body* or *payload*. We say that the application’s data is
*encapsulated* in the new message created by UDP.

To make the discussion a more concrete, :numref:`Figures %s
<fig-udphdr>`, :numref:`%s <fig-tcphdr>`, :numref:`%s
<fig-iphdr>`, and :numref:`%s <fig-ethhdr>` depict the header for four
protocols we use as examples in this section: TCP, UDP, IP, and
Ethernet, respectively.  The examples include two different (but
common) formats for depicting protocol headers: as a sequence of
fields spread over 32-bit words (TCP, UDP and IP) and as a sequence of
fields of specified bit lengths (ETH). We'll explain the meaning of
most of these fields in later chapters, but there is some commonality
in all headers, which we describe in the next subsection.

   :width: 600px
   :align: center

   Ethernet header specification.

Another way to document protocol headers is the source code that
implements the protocol.  For example, the following code snippet for
the UDP header is taken from the Linux kernel, where ``__be16`` and
``__sum16`` are kernel-defined types for 16-bit unsigned integers.  A
header structure like this essentially defines the set of parameters that
protocol modules pass to each other over their peer-to-peer interface.

.. code-block:: c

   struct udphdr {
        __be16	source;
        __be16	dest;
        __be16	len;
        __sum16	check;
   };

The process of encapsulation is then repeated at each level of the
protocol graph; for example, IP encapsulates UDP’s message by
attaching a header of its own; ETH does the same with the IP
packet. If we now assume that ETH sends the message to its peer over
some network, then when the message arrives at the destination host,
it is processed in the opposite order: ETH first interprets the ETH
header at the front of the message (i.e., takes whatever action is
appropriate given the contents of the header) and passes the body of
the message (but not the ETH header) up to IP, which takes whatever
action is indicated by the IP header that its peer attached and passes
the body of the message (but not the IP header) up to UDP, which does
the same. The message passed up from UDP to the application on host 2
is exactly the same message as the application passed down to UDP on
host 1; the application does not see any of the headers that have been
attached to it to implement the lower-level communication services.
This whole process is illustrated in :numref:`Figure %s
<fig-encapsulation>`. Note that in a multi-hop network, intermediate
nodes (e.g., switches and routers) may inspect their header to determine
how to forward the message on towards its destination. They may also
modify the header before forwarding it.

.. _fig-encapsulation:
.. figure:: introduction/figures/encapsulation.png
   :width: 600px
   :align: center

   High-level messages are encapsulated inside of low-level messages.

Note that when we say a low-level protocol does not interpret the
message it is given by some high-level protocol, we mean that it does
not know how to extract any meaning from the data contained in the
message. It is sometimes the case, however, that the low-level protocol
applies some algorithmic transformation to the data it is given, such as to
compress or encrypt it. In this case, the protocol is transforming the
entire body of the message, including both the original application’s
data and all the headers attached to that data by higher-level
protocols.

As Internet protocols, the specifications for IP, TCP, and
UDP—including their header formats—are given in official documents
known as *Request for Comments*, or *RFCs* for short. For example, RFC
791 is the original spec for IP, RFC 793 is the original spec for TCP,
and RFC 768 is the original spec for UDP.  All three protocols have
been updated over time (and new RFCs issued), but as a general
introduction to what a protocol definition looks like, these three
RFCs are a good place to start.

|Intro|.3.4 Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each of the protocols in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-protograph>` is
potentially asked to send and receive messages on behalf of multiple
high-level users. (Here, we use the term "user" to mean any
application or protocol that uses a protocol to deliver messages on
its behalf.) This means that in the same way we might multiplex
multiple data flows over a single physical link, we can also think of
every protocol as multiplexing multiple user flows over a logical
connection to its peer on another machine.

Practically speaking, this means that the header a given protocol
attaches to its messages contains an identifier that records the user
to which the message belongs. We call this identifier a
*demultiplexing key*, or *demux key* for short. At the source host, a
protocol includes the appropriate demux key in its header. When the
message is delivered to its peer on the destination host, the peer
strips its header, examines the demux key, and demultiplexes the
message up to the correct user.

Unfortunately, there is no uniform agreement among protocols—even
those within a single network architecture—on exactly what constitutes
a demux key.  Some protocols use an 8-bit field (meaning they can
support only 256 high-level protocols), and others use 16- or 32-bit
fields. Also, some protocols have a single demultiplexing field in
their header, while others have a pair of demultiplexing fields. In
the former case, the same demux key is used on both sides of the
communication, while in the latter case, each side uses a different key
to identify the high-level protocol (or application program) to which
the message is to be delivered.

Looking back at the example headers given in :numref:`Figures %s
<fig-tcphdr>`, :numref:`%s <fig-udphdr>`, :numref:`%s <fig-iphdr>`,
and :numref:`%s <fig-ethhdr>`, IP uses the 8-bit ``Protocol`` field as
its demux key, with ``0x11`` (decimal 17) indicating the message
belongs to UDP and ``0x06`` (decimal 6) indicating the message belongs
to TCP. Similarly, Ethernet uses the 16-bit ``Type`` field as its
demux key, with ``0x0800`` indicating the message belongs to IP.  TCP
and UDP are example protocols that use a different demux key on each
end, corresponding to the 16-bit ``SrcPort`` and ``DstPort``
fields. Assigning demux keys to different protocols and applications
is part of a network's specification since everyone has to agree to
their meaning.

Other fields in our example headers only make sense when you look at
what the protocol is trying to do (which we'll do in later chapters),
but some are typical of protocols in general. For example, many
headers indicate how long the message is (e.g., the ``Length`` field
in the IP and UDP headers); how long the header is (e.g., IP and TCP's
``HLen`` field); and some form of error code used to detect and
possibly correct bit errors (e.g., IP, TCP, and UDP's ``Checksum`` and
ETH's ``CRC``).

The host addresses in the IP and ETH headers are also noteworthy.
The field names are the same—\ ``SourceAddr`` and
``DestinationAddr``\ —and both protocols use their respective addresses
to uniquely identify the sender and receiver of every message. But the
addressing schemes the Internet and Ethernet use are completely
different. We'll describe those schemes in later chapters, but for
now, we briefly introduce the standard way we make them
human-readable.  Ethernet's 48-bit addresses are usually written as
six hexadecimal numbers, one for each 8-bit byte in the address. For
example, ``6e:86:88:18:7d:39``. A 32-bit IP address is typically
written as four decimal numbers, one for each 8-bit byte in the
address. For example, ``128.112.155.172``.  This is called "dot
notation" for the obvious reason. Note that there are situations where
we only care about some prefix of an IP address, say the first 16 or
24 bits, in which case we'll write ``128.112.0.0/16`` or
``128.112.155.0/24``. We do this because the prefix identifies the
network that a host is connected to, and that's the bit of
information we want to know.

Finally, you may have noticed that the definition of UDP in RFC 768 is
only three pages long. This is because UDP's sole purpose is to layer
a user-level demultiplexing capability—in the form of a
source/destination port pair—on top of IP's best-effort packet
delivery service. In doing to, UDP turns IP's host-to-host service
into a process-to-process service.
