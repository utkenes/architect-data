// ── spine/replay/replay — a LIVE run against its REPLAY (G9) ───────────────
// The shipped harness folded the same in-memory array TWICE through a pure
// function and asserted equality — true by definition, and measured to pass even
// with seam 07's own named violation injected (a tool reading a mutable global and
// performing a side effect). That double-fold is DELETED. It caught nothing, and
// the thing it claimed to catch is structurally impossible for it to see.
//
// What replay actually buys (14.1.1): determinism over a RECORDED TIMELINE —
// forensics, audit, production-traces-as-fixtures. It is NOT behavioural
// reproducibility: re-running the model is not deterministic, and inputs conflated
// away were never recorded. What IS guaranteed is that the run that WAS recorded
// re-derives exactly, bit for bit, from its own committed bytes.
//
// A live-source tool is caught by a CHECK (gate check C8), not by this harness.
//
// TWO CONSTRUCTED HOSTS, no top-level functions:
//
//     Replay(fold, admission).refold(initial, records)            -> RefoldOutcome
//     Replay(fold, admission).stateAtStep(initial, records, k)    -> the same, over a PREFIX
//     Replay(fold, admission).collectPerform(initial, records, sink, mode)
//     ReplayFaithfulness(fold, projectContext, promptVersion, admission, bounds)
//         .assertFaithful(initial, records, liveState, liveEffects)
//
// The split is the one spine/boundary/Action.kt already makes: what is CONSTANT for
// one app — the fold, the projection, the prompt version — is constructor-held and
// drops out of every signature; what VARIES per call — which timeline, which sink,
// which mode — stays an argument. A top-level function has no instance: nothing
// builds it, so nothing can stand in for it, so it can only be reached through
// whatever calls it.
//
// `fold` is INJECTED here, which is the opposite of the choice Boundary.kt makes for
// its gate, and the difference is structural rather than stylistic. The spine is
// generic in S precisely because it cannot know the app's fold, and replay is
// READ-ONLY over an already-committed bus: it mints no ToolResult and appends
// nothing, so C7's single-production-site guarantee is untouched by letting a caller
// bind it. A bindable gate would be a bypassable gate; a bindable re-fold bypasses
// nothing, because there is no authority on this path to bypass.
//
// ReplayFaithfulness BUILDS its own re-fold instead of accepting one, for the
// inverse reason: its digest walk and its re-fold must provably follow the SAME
// fold. Hand the two halves different folds and the assertion compares two
// different runs and passes — the vacuous harness this file exists to end.

// ── SNAPSHOT — a memoized fold prefix, and a tag that can REFUSE (14.1) ────
// Folding from genesis on every restart, scrub or recovery is O(timeline), and the
// deployments this architecture most recommends — a server agent, an ambient
// assistant — run indefinitely. 14.1's steel note gives the purity-preserving
// extension and its equation:
//
//     fold(snapshot@k, timeline[k..])  ==  fold(initialState, timeline)
//
// …and the rule that keeps it honest: tag every snapshot with the REDUCER VERSION
// and the TIMELINE OFFSET it covers, because a snapshot taken under an old reducer
// is untrustworthy under a new one (14.7).
//
// A TAG THAT IS ONLY CARRIED IS DECORATION — and an integer cannot police itself.
// Take the ONLY resume site a STORED snapshot permits: a reader holds a snapshot
// blob and a log, and nothing else in this system knows which prefix that blob
// covers, because [StepRecord] carries no step index. So the reader must ask the log
// for the tail at `snapshot.tag.offset`, and any check of the form
// `tag.offset == tail.from` is then `x == x`. Corrupt the integer and the wrong tail
// folds into a plausible answer. That is MEASURED, not feared: against a first draft
// of this file, eight of eight corrupted offsets resumed.
//
// So the extent is checked by CONTENT, and the two halves have two authors:
//
//   · [SnapshotTag.coveredThrough] — the mark of the last record the prefix ACTUALLY
//     folded, copied off that record when the snapshot was minted.
//   · [TimelineTail.follows] — the mark of the record the LOG finds immediately
//     before the tail it hands back, read from its own bytes at resume time.
//
// Two sources, one fact. Hand the resume a corrupted offset and the log answers with
// a DIFFERENT record's mark, so the seam disagrees instead of folding.
//
// The bare offsets are still compared, and that check is not redundant: it is the one
// that catches a snapshot whose literal was misfiled against a tail somebody ELSE
// selected — the case where the two numbers genuinely do have two authors. It is a
// cheap second opinion, not the load-bearing one.
//
// WHAT THIS SEAM CANNOT SEE, said here rather than left for a reader to discover.
// The mark discriminates two offsets only when the two records DIFFER, and nothing
// in this reference guarantees that:
//
//   · two records with the same `now` AND the same rendered context are one fact to
//     this seam, so a drift between exactly those two offsets resumes. Both halves
//     earn their place against that — THIS port's canonical session contains a pair
//     whose contexts render identically, separated only by the clock; freeze the
//     clock and the mark separates 7 of 8. Measured, pinned in ReplayTest, not
//     closed.
//   · two DIFFERENT logs whose boundary records are byte-identical are likewise
//     indistinguishable.
//   · a tag forged CONSISTENTLY — offset and mark moved together — is a forgery of
//     the snapshot's own provenance that no tag field can catch.
//
// A deployment that needs more than this gives the log a per-record identity the
// reference does not mint; that is a store's job, and the store is product-owned
// (16.2).
//
// The tail stays an ARGUMENT rather than something [Replay.refoldFrom] slices out of
// a whole timeline, because 14.1's steel note says compacting below a snapshot trades
// away the ability to scrub or fork before that point: a resume that demanded the
// whole log could not run in the deployment that note exists for. A compacting store
// persists its boundary mark; [Recovery.tailFrom] computes it from the records it
// still holds.
//
// The snapshot stays a DERIVED CACHE: nothing here appends, and the timeline can
// always rebuild it. WHERE a snapshot is STORED, and how far below one a deployment
// may compact, remain product policy (16.2).
