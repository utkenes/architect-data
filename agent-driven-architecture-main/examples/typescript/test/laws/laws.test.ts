// ── THE GATE FOR THE LAW REGISTRY, and its own block/allow pair ───────────
//
// §15.2's bar, applied to the registry itself: this meta-check ships a
// VIOLATING registry it must reject and a COMPLIANT one it must accept, both
// under test/laws/fixtures/. Delete any assertion body below and its
// block-test goes red immediately.
//
// Seven things are asserted against the SHIPPED laws.toml:
//   (a) every law declares an enforcement layer, from the closed vocabulary,
//       and the book's headline and the machine field agree in both directions;
//       (a') THE FLOOR RULE for the configuration-time rung: one `layers` field
//       prints one cell speaking for BOTH ports, so the rung may be claimed only
//       with a build edge named PER PORT — checked in both directions;
//   (b) a law held by a denying check names one, every on-disk fixture pointer
//       RESOLVES to a non-empty path, and no LINT-OWNED check claims the
//       value-check pair shape; (b') the value-check shape is held to the SAME
//       bar — an in-checker row names its two TEST SITES and each is RESOLVED,
//       because the branch used to require two empty fields and demand nothing
//       in their place, which is a check shipping no block-test at all, green;
//   (c) the registry regenerates the book's §15.3 table byte for byte, off a
//       SINGLE four-cell row per law — the shape §15's inversion put there,
//       with (c') holding that shape against a re-separated layer table;
//   (d) every check on each port's OWN roster traces to a law, per (law, port,
//       id) — four ids hold two laws each, so a set keyed on the id alone would
//       let either occurrence be deleted;
//   (e) a law whose NOTE credits a check with holding it names at least one;
//   (g) the PROSE around the table cannot outlive the registry — the book states
//       the vocabulary's size and no longer denies the module graph. The
//       regenerator owns the fourth CELL only, so the sentences that FRAME the
//       table had no owner at all, and both of them went stale at once;
//   (h) every BUILD EDGE resolves and still declares the token it names —
//       "pointers are resolved, never trusted", applied to the newest field.
//
// THE OWNERSHIP ORACLE IS DERIVED. `lintOwned` below is read out of the
// SHIPPED eslint config source — the `[Cn]` marker every message carries, plus
// the one rule id whose wording we do not author — exactly as the Kotlin gate
// derives `konsistOwned` from the real konsist rule list. Reading ownership off
// a hand-authored token instead would let one edited character move a live lint
// rule into the value-check carve-out and shed its fixture pair, green.
