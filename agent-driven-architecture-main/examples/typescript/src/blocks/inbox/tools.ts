// ── blocks/inbox/tools — the Verb table ────────────────────────────────────
// Both verbs are `Reversible`: recording that the system shed load changes no
// outside-world state and needs no second principal.
//
// These are ORDINARY verbs, and that is the whole reason the consumer needs no
// new spine machinery to be observable. The consumer emits an Action; the Action
// resolves through the one name→ToolResult map, passes the gate, folds, commits
// and signs. A busy-drop is a decision, so it signs — exactly like 6.8's
// presentation verbs. Wire a consumer without this block and the Action still
// resolves, to a committed `Unhandled`: still on the timeline, never silent.
