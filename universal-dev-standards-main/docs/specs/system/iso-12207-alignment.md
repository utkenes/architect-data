# System Spec: ISO/IEC 12207 Alignment for Vibe Coding

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: Archived
**Spec ID**: SYS-ISO-12207

## 1. Overview

This specification defines the architectural mapping between ISO/IEC 12207 (Software Life Cycle Processes) and the "Vibe Coding" (AI-Assisted Development) ecosystem within Universal Development Standards (UDS).

It formalizes AI Agents not merely as tools, but as "Virtual Suppliers" and "Virtual Workforce," requiring formalized Agreement and Enabling processes.

## 2. Architectural Mapping

### 2.1 Agreement Processes (Group 6.1)

In Vibe Coding, the "Agreement" is strictly digital and context-based.

| ISO 12207 Process | UDS Component | Implementation Mechanism |
|-------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **Acquisition** (6.1.1) | **Context Contract** | `core/ai-agreement-standards.md`<br>Defining the "Request for Proposal" via Prompt Engineering standards. |
| **Supply** (6.1.2) | **Generation Protocol** | AI Response Guidelines (Anti-Hallucination)<br>Validation of output against the Context Contract. |

### 2.2 Organizational Project-Enabling Processes (Group 6.2)

UDS treats the AI ecosystem as a virtual organization requiring management.

| ISO 12207 Process | UDS Component | Implementation Mechanism |
|-------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **Infrastructure Management** (6.2.2) | **Tool Integration** | `core/virtual-organization-standards.md`<br>Management of MCP servers, API keys, and RAG vectors. |
| **Human Resource Management** (6.2.4) | **Skill Management** | `skills/` directory structure<br>Treating AI Skills as "Employee Capabilities" that are hired (installed) and trained (configured). |
| **Quality Management** (6.2.5) | **Vibe Checks** | `uds check`<br>Automated compliance gates that replace manual QA for AI outputs. |

### 2.3 Technical Processes (Group 6.4)

Mapping existing UDS standards to the technical lifecycle.

| ISO 12207 Process | UDS Component |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Stakeholder Requirements (6.4.1) | `core/requirement-engineering.md` |
| Software Implementation (6.4.4) | `core/checkin-standards.md` |
| Software Verification (6.4.7) | `core/testing-standards.md` |
| Software Maintenance (6.4.10) | `core/refactoring-standards.md` |

## 3. System Requirements

### 3.1 The "Context Contract" Object
The system shall support a formalized JSON/Markdown structure that defines:
- **Role**: The persona of the AI (e.g., "Senior Architect").
- **Constraints**: Strict boundaries of operation (e.g., "Read-only on /docs").
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Verifiable conditions for task completion.

### 3.2 The "Virtual Role" Definition
The system shall support defining "Roles" which are collections of:
- Specific **Skills** (Tools).
- Specific **Context** (Knowledge).
- Specific **Permissions** (Safety).

## 4. Compliance Verification

- **Audit**: The `uds check` command shall verify the existence of Context Contracts (e.g., `CLAUDE.md`) and Skill Definitions.
- **Traceability**: All AI-generated code must be traceable back to a specific Agreement (Prompt/Context).
