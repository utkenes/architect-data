## <a name="question"></a> Question

How should the boundaries of core entities be defined to encapsulate business rules in a stable and reusable way?

## <a name="options"></a> Options

1. <a name="option-1"></a> Define dedicated domain entities representing key business concepts, independent of frameworks or infrastructure.
2. <a name="option-2"></a> Use simple data structures or records (e.g., DTOs or structs) and keep business logic external.
3. <a name="option-3"></a> Postpone entity modeling until implementation details are clearer (emergent modeling).

## <a name="criteria"></a> Criteria

- Stability and reusability across different applications or bounded contexts
- Degree of encapsulation and abstraction from external systems
- Clarity and alignment with core business rules
- Development effort and complexity of maintaining separation
