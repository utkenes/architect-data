|Stream|.3 Transport Protocol
------------------------------

We now turn our attention to the transport protocol used to deliver
real-time media, which as we noted in Section |Stream|.1, needs to
avoid the possibility of unbounded delay by retransmitting dropped
packets. The protocol also needs to account for other application
requirements, such as synchronizing separate audio
and video streams.

Settling on the functionality to be bundled in a *Real-time Transport
Protocol (RTP)*, as the result came to be called, happened
iteratively. Early prototypes embedded the functionality in the
application, the first two of the first were ``vic`` and ``vat``; the
former supported real-time video and the latter supported real-time
audio. Both applications originally ran directly over UDP, while the
designers figured out which features were needed to handle the
real-time nature of the communication. Later, they realized that these
features could be useful to many other applications and defined a
protocol with those features.

RTP can run over many lower-layer protocols, but commonly runs over
UDP. That leads to the protocol stack shown in :numref:`Figure %s
<fig-vat-stack>`. Note that we are therefore running a transport
protocol over a transport protocol (just as QUIC does). UDP provides a
minimal level of functionality, and the basic demultiplexing based on
port numbers is just what RTP needs as a starting point. So, rather
than recreate port numbers in RTP, RTP outsources the demultiplexing
function to UDP.

   Protocol stack for multimedia applications using RTP.

|Stream|.3.1 Common Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RTP's design was an exercise in identifying functionality that is
common to all (or most) real-time applications. This suggests an
obvious starting point: a general-purpose multimedia protocol must
allow similar applications to interoperate with each other. For
example, it should be possible for two independently implemented
audioconferencing applications to talk to each other. This immediately
suggests that the applications should use the same method of encoding
and compressing voice; otherwise, the data sent by one party will be
incomprehensible to the receiving party. With a multitude of different
coding schemes for voice, each with its own trade-offs among quality,
bandwidth requirements, and computational cost, we can not decree that
only one such scheme can be used.  Instead, our protocol should
provide a way that a sender can tell a receiver which coding scheme it
wants to use, and possibly negotiate until a scheme that is available
to both parties is identified.

Just as with audio, there are many different video coding schemes. Thus,
we see that the first common function that RTP can provide is the
ability to communicate that choice of coding scheme. Note that this also
serves to identify the type of application (e.g., audio or video); once
we know what coding algorithm is being used, we know what type of data
is being encoded as well.

A second important function is to enable the recipient of a data
stream to determine the timing relationship among the received data.
Real-time applications need to place received data into a *playback
buffer* to smooth out the jitter that may have been introduced into
the data stream during transmission across the network. Thus, some
sort of timestamping of the data will be necessary to enable the
receiver to play it back at the appropriate time.

Related to the timing of a single media stream is the issue of
synchronization of multiple media in a conference. The obvious example
of this would be to synchronize an audio and video stream that are
originating from the same sender. As we describe below, this is a
slightly more complex problem than playback time determination for a
single stream.

A third general function to be provided is an indication of packet
loss. As we've discussed, an application with tight latency bounds
generally cannot use a reliable transport like TCP because
retransmission of data to correct for loss would probably cause the
packet to arrive too late to be useful. Thus, the application must be
able to deal with missing packets, and the first step in dealing with
them is noticing that they are in fact missing. As an example, a video
application using MPEG encoding may take different actions when a
packet is lost, depending on whether the packet came from an I frame,
a B frame, or a P frame.

Packet loss is also a potential indicator of congestion. Since real-time
multimedia applications do not run over TCP, they also miss
out on the congestion avoidance features of TCP. Yet, many multimedia
applications are capable of responding to congestion—for example, by
changing the parameters of the coding algorithm to reduce the bandwidth
consumed. Clearly, to make this work, the receiver needs to notify the
sender that losses are occurring so that the sender can adjust its
coding parameters.

A fourth common function across multimedia applications is mechanism
that indicates frame boundaries, where a frame is application
specific. For example, it may be helpful to notify a video application
that a certain set of packets correspond to a single video frame,
whereas in an audio application, it is helpful to mark the beginning
of a “talkspurt” (a collection of sounds or words followed by
silence). The receiver can then identify the silences between
talkspurts and use them as opportunities to move the playback
point. This follows the observation that slight shortening or
lengthening of the spaces between words are not perceptible to users,
whereas shortening or lengthening the words themselves is both
perceptible and annoying.

A final function that we might want to put into a general real-time
protocol is some way of identifying senders that is more user-friendly
than an IP address. Audio and video conferencing applications can
display strings such as ``Username <user@example.com>`` on their
control panels, and thus the application protocol should support the
association of such a string with a data stream.

In addition to the common functionality that we've identified, there
is also the requirement that the transport protocol should make
reasonably efficient use of bandwidth. Put another way, we don’t want
to introduce a lot of extra bits that need to be sent with every
packet in the form of a long header. The reason for this is that audio
packets, one of the most common types of multimedia data, tend to be
small, so as to reduce the time it takes to fill them with
samples. Long audio packets would mean high latency due to
packetization, which has a negative effect on the perceived quality of
conversations. Since the data packets themselves are short, a large
header would consume a relatively large amount of link bandwidth, thus
reducing the available capacity for “useful” data. We will see several
aspects of the design of RTP that have been influenced by the
necessity of keeping the header short.

You could argue whether every single feature just described *really*
needs to be in a real-time transport protocol, and you could probably
find some more that could be added. The key idea here is to make life
easier for application developers by giving them a useful set of
abstractions and building blocks for their applications. For example, by
putting a timestamping mechanism into RTP, we save every developer of a
real-time application from inventing their own. We also increase the
chances that two different real-time applications might interoperate.

|Stream|.3.2 Protocol Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have seen the rather long list of functions that it makes
sense for general real-time transport protocol to bundle, we turn to
the details of the specific protocol, RTP.  The standard, as
originally defined in RFC 1889 (and later updated by RFC 3550)
actually defines a pair of protocols, RTP and the Real-time Transport
Control Protocol (RTCP). The former is used for the exchange of
multimedia data, while the latter is used to periodically send control
information associated with a certain data flow. When running over
UDP, the RTP data stream and the associated RTCP control stream use
consecutive transport-layer ports. The RTP data uses an even port
number and the RTCP control information uses the next higher (odd)
port number.

   Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications
   <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3550>`__. RFC 3550, July 2003.

Because RTP is designed to support a wide variety of applications, it
provides a flexible mechanism by which new applications can be developed
without repeatedly revising the RTP protocol itself. For each class of
application (e.g., audio), RTP defines a *profile* and one or more
*formats*. The profile provides a range of information that ensures a
common understanding of the fields in the RTP header for that
application class, as will be apparent when we examine the header in
detail. The format specification explains how the data that follows the
RTP header is to be interpreted. For example, the RTP header might just
be followed by a sequence of bytes, each of which represents a single
audio sample taken a defined interval after the previous one.
Alternatively, the format of the data might be much more complex; an
MPEG-encoded video stream, for example, would need to have a good deal
of structure to represent all the different types of information.

.. takeaway::

   The design of RTP embodies an architectural principle
   known as *Application Level Framing* (ALF). This principle was put
   forward by Clark and Tennenhouse in 1990 as a way to design
   protocols for emerging multimedia applications. They recognized
   that these new applications were unlikely to be well served by
   existing protocols such as TCP, and that furthermore they might not
   be well served by any sort of “one-size-fits-all” protocol. At the
   heart of this principle is the belief that an application
   understands its own needs best. For example, an MPEG video
   application knows how best to recover from lost frames and how to
   react differently if an I frame or a B frame is lost. The same
   application also understands best how to segment the data for
   transmission—for example, it’s better to send the data from
   different frames in different datagrams, so that a lost packet only
   corrupts a single frame, not two. It is for this reason that RTP
   leaves so many of the protocol details to the profile and format
   documents that are specific to an application.

Header Format
+++++++++++++++

:numref:`Figure %s <fig-rtp-hdr>` shows the header format used by
RTP. The first 12 bytes are always present, whereas the contributing
source identifiers are only used in certain circumstances. After this
header there may be optional header extensions, as described
below. Finally, the header is followed by the RTP payload, the format
of which is determined by the application. The intention of this
header is that it contain only the fields that are likely to be used
by many different applications, since anything that is very specific
to a single application would be more efficiently carried in the RTP
payload for that application only.

   :align: center

   RTP header format.

The first two bits are a version identifier, which contains the value 2
in the RTP version deployed at the time of writing. You might think that
the designers of the protocol were rather bold to think that 2 bits
would be enough to contain all future versions of RTP, but recall that
bits are at a premium in the RTP header. Furthermore, the use of
profiles for different applications makes it less likely that many
revisions to the base RTP protocol would be needed. In any case, if it
turns out that another version of RTP is needed beyond version 2, it
would be possible to consider a change to the header format so that more
than one future version would be possible. For example, a new RTP header
with the value 3 in the version field could have a “subversion” field
somewhere else in the header.

The next bit is the *padding* (``P``) bit, which is set in
circumstances in which the RTP payload has been padded for some
reason. RTP data might be padded to fill up a block of a certain size
as required by an encryption algorithm, for example. In such a case,
the complete length of the RTP header, data, and padding would be
conveyed by the lower-layer protocol header (e.g., the UDP header),
and the last byte of the padding would contain a count of how many
bytes should be ignored.  This is illustrated in :numref:`Figure %s
<fig-rtp-pad>`. Note that this approach to padding removes any need
for a length field in the RTP header (thus serving the goal of keeping
the header short); in the common case of no padding, the length is
deduced from the lower-layer protocol.

   :align: center

   Padding of an RTP packet.

The *extension* (``X``) bit is used to indicate the presence of an
extension header, which would be defined for a specific application and
follow the main header. Such headers are rarely used, since it is
generally possible to define a payload-specific header as part of the
payload format definition for a particular application.

The ``X`` bit is followed by a 4-bit field that counts the number of
*contributing sources*, if any are included in the header. Contributing
sources are discussed below.

We noted above the frequent need for some sort of frame indication; this
is provided by the marker bit, which has a profile-specific use. For a
voice application, it could be set at the beginning of a talkspurt, for
example. The 7-bit payload type field follows; it indicates what type of
multimedia data is carried in this packet. One possible use of this
field would be to enable an application to switch from one coding scheme
to another based on information about resource availability in the
network or feedback on application quality. The exact usage of the
payload type is also determined by the application profile.

Note that the payload type is generally not used as a demultiplexing
key to direct data to different applications (or to different streams
within a single application, such as the audio and video stream for a
videoconference). This is because such demultiplexing is typically
provided at a lower layer by UDP. In other words, two media streams
using RTP would typically use different UDP port numbers.

The sequence number is used to enable the receiver of an RTP stream to
detect missing and misordered packets. The sender simply increments the
value by one for each transmitted packet. Note that RTP does not do
anything when it detects a lost packet, in contrast to TCP, which both
corrects for the loss (by retransmission) and interprets the loss as a
congestion indication (which may cause it to reduce its window size).
Rather, it is left to the application to decide what to do when a packet
is lost because this decision is likely to be highly application
dependent. For example, a video application might decide that the best
thing to do when a packet is lost is to replay the last frame that was
correctly received. Some applications might also decide to modify their
coding algorithms to reduce bandwidth needs in response to loss, but
this is not a function of RTP. It would not be sensible for RTP to
decide that the sending rate should be reduced, as this might make the
application useless.

The function of the timestamp field is to enable the receiver to play
back samples at the appropriate intervals and to enable different media
streams to be synchronized. Because different applications may require
different granularities of timing, RTP itself does not specify the units
in which time is measured. Instead, the timestamp is just a counter of
“ticks,” where the time between ticks is dependent on the encoding in
use. For example, an audio application that samples data once every
125 μs could use that value as its clock resolution. The clock
granularity is one of the details that is specified in the RTP profile
or payload format for an application.

The timestamp value in the packet is a number representing the time at
which the *first* sample in the packet was generated. The timestamp is
not a reflection of the time of day; only the differences between
timestamps are relevant. For example, if the sampling interval is
125 μs and the first sample in packet n+1 was generated 10 ms after
the first sample in packet n, then the number of sampling instants
between these two samples is

.. centered:: TimeBetweenPackets / TimePerSample

.. centered:: = (10 × 10\ :sup:`-3`\ ) / (125 × 10\ :sup:`-6`\ ) = 80

Assuming the clock granularity is the same as the sampling interval,
then the timestamp in packet n+1 would be greater than that in packet n
by 80. Note that fewer than 80 samples might have been sent due to
compression techniques such as silence detection, and yet the timestamp
allows the receiver to play back the samples with the correct temporal
relationship.

The synchronization source (SSRC) is a 32-bit number that uniquely
identifies a single source of an RTP stream. In a given multimedia
conference, each sender picks a random SSRC and is expected to resolve
conflicts in the unlikely event that two sources pick the same value. By
making the source identifier something other than the network or
transport address of the source, RTP ensures independence from the
lower-layer protocol. It also enables a single node with multiple
sources (e.g., several cameras) to distinguish those sources. When a
single node generates different media streams (e.g., audio and video),
it is not required to use the same SSRC in each stream, as there are
mechanisms in RTCP (described below) to allow intermedia
synchronization.

The contributing source (CSRC) is used only when a number of RTP streams
pass through a mixer. A mixer can be used to reduce the bandwidth
requirements for a conference by receiving data from many sources and
sending it as a single stream. For example, the audio streams from
several concurrent speakers could be decoded and recoded as a single
audio stream. In this case, the mixer lists itself as the
synchronization source but also lists the contributing sources—the SSRC
values of the speakers who contributed to the packet in question.

|Stream|.3.3 Control Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RTCP provides a control stream that is associated with a data stream for
a multimedia application. This control stream provides three main
functions:

1. Feedback on the performance of the application and the network

2. A way to correlate and synchronize different media streams that have
   come from the same sender

3. A way to convey the identity of a sender for display on a user
   interface.

The first function may be useful for detecting and responding to
congestion. Some applications are able to operate at different rates and
may use performance data to decide to use a more aggressive compression
scheme to reduce congestion, for example, or to send a higher-quality
stream when there is little congestion. Performance feedback can also be
useful in diagnosing network problems.

You might think that the second function is already provided by the
synchronization source ID (SSRC) of RTP, but in fact it is not. As
already noted, multiple cameras from a single node might have different
SSRC values. Furthermore, there is no requirement that an audio and
video stream from the same node use the same SSRC. Because collisions of
SSRC values may occur, it may be necessary to change the SSRC value of a
stream. To deal with this problem, RTCP uses the concept of a *canonical
name* (CNAME) that is assigned to a sender, which is then associated
with the various SSRC values that might be used by that sender using
RTCP mechanisms.

Simply correlating two streams is only part of the problem of intermedia
synchronization. Because different streams may have completely different
clocks (with different granularities and even different amounts of
inaccuracy, or drift), there needs to be a way to accurately synchronize
streams with each other. RTCP addresses this problem by conveying timing
information that correlates actual time of day with the
clock-rate-dependent timestamps that are carried in RTP data packets.

RTCP defines a number of different packet types, including

-  Sender reports, which enable active senders to a session to report
   transmission and reception statistics

-  Receiver reports, which receivers who are not senders use to report
   reception statistics

-  Source descriptions, which carry CNAMEs and other sender description
   information

-  Application-specific control packets

These different RTCP packet types are sent over the lower-layer
protocol, which, as we have noted, is typically UDP. Several RTCP
packets can be packed into a single PDU of the lower-level protocol. It
is required that at least two RTCP packets are sent in every lower-level
PDU: One of these is a report packet; the other is a source description
packet. Other packets may be included up to the size limits imposed by
the lower-layer protocols.

Before looking further at the contents of an RTCP packet, we note that
there is a potential problem with every member of a multicast group
sending periodic control traffic. Unless we take some steps to limit it,
this control traffic has the potential to be a significant consumer of
bandwidth. In an audioconference, for example, no more than two or three
senders are likely to send audio data at any instant, since there is no
point in everyone talking at once. But there is no such social limit on
everyone sending control traffic, and this could be a severe problem in
a conference with thousands of participants.

To deal with this problem, RTCP has a set of mechanisms by which the
participants scale back their reporting frequency as the number of
participants increases.  These rules are complex, but the goal is to
limit the total amount of RTCP traffic to a small percentage
(typically 5%) of the RTP data traffic. To accomplish this, the
participants should know how much data bandwidth is likely to be in
use (e.g., the amount to send three audio streams) and the number of
participants. They learn the former from means outside RTP (known as
*session management*, discussed in the next section), and they learn
the latter from the RTCP reports of other participants. Because RTCP
reports might be sent at a very low rate, it might only be possible to
get an approximate count of the current number of recipients, but that
is typically sufficient. Also, it is recommended to allocate more RTCP
bandwidth to active senders, on the assumption that most participants
would like to see reports from them—for example, to find out who is
speaking.

Once a participant has determined how much bandwidth it can consume
with RTCP traffic, it sets about sending periodic reports at the
appropriate rate. Sender reports and receiver reports differ only in
that the former include some extra information about the sender. Both
types of reports contain information about the data that was received
from all sources in the most recent reporting period.  The extra
information in a sender report consists of the following:

-  A timestamp containing the actual time of day when this report was
   generated

-  The RTP timestamp corresponding to the time when the report was
   generated

-  Cumulative counts of the packets and bytes sent by this sender since
   it began transmission

Note that the first two quantities can be used to enable synchronization
of different media streams from the same source, even if those streams
use different clock granularities in their RTP data streams, since it
gives the key to convert time of day to the RTP timestamps.

Both sender and receiver reports contain one block of data per source
that has been heard from since the last report. Each block contains the
following statistics for the source in question:

-  Its SSRC

-  The fraction of data packets from this source that were lost since
   the last report was sent (calculated by comparing the number of
   packets received with the number of packets expected; this last value
   can be determined from the RTP sequence numbers)

-  Total number of packets lost from this source since the first time it
   was heard from

-  Highest sequence number received from this source (extended to
   32 bits to account for wrapping of the sequence number)

-  Estimated interarrival jitter for the source (calculated by comparing
   the interarrival spacing of received packets with the expected
   spacing at transmission time)

-  Last actual timestamp received via RTCP for this source

-  Delay since last sender report received via RTCP for this source

As you might imagine, the recipients of this information can learn a
lot about the state of the session. In particular, they can see if
other recipients are getting much better quality from some sender than
they are, which might be an indication of a problem in the network
that needs to be attended to. In addition, if a sender notices that
many receivers are experiencing high loss of its packets, it might
decide that it should reduce its sending rate or use a coding scheme
that is more resilient to loss.

A final aspect of RTCP to consider is the source description packet.
Such a packet contains, at a minimum, the SSRC of the sender and the
sender’s CNAME. The canonical name is derived in such a way that all
applications that generate media streams that might need to be
synchronized (e.g., separately generated audio and video streams from
the same user) will choose the same CNAME even though they might
choose different SSRC values. This enables a receiver to identify the
media stream that came from the same sender. The most common format of
the CNAME is ``user@host``, where ``host`` is the fully qualified
domain name of the sending machine.  Thus, an application launched by
the user whose user name is ``jdoe`` running on the machine
``cicada.cs.princeton.edu`` would use the string
``jdoe@cicada.cs.princeton.edu`` as its CNAME. The large and variable
number of bytes used in this representation would make it a bad choice
for the format of an SSRC, since the SSRC is sent with every data
packet and must be processed in real time. Allowing CNAMEs to be bound
to SSRC values in periodic RTCP messages enables a compact and
efficient format for the SSRC.

Other items may be included in the source description packet, such as
the real name and email address of the user. These are used in user
interface displays and to contact participants, but are less essential
to the operation of RTP than the CNAME.

Like TCP, RTP and RTCP are a fairly complex pair of protocols. This
complexity comes in large part from the desire to make life easier for
application designers. Because there is an infinite number of possible
applications, the challenge in designing a transport protocol is to make
it general enough to meet the widely varying needs of many different
applications without making the protocol itself impossible to implement.
RTP has proven very successful in this regard, forming the basis for
many real-time multimedia applications run over the Internet today.
