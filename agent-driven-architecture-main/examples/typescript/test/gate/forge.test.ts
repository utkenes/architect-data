// ── G1 / C4 — THE STAMP CANNOT BE SPELLED, ONLY MINTED ─────────────────────
//
// `Signature` used to be a plain interface, and a plain interface is
// STRUCTURAL: every fold arm in the tree legitimately RECEIVES one, and a type
// a file may name is a type that file may also spell. MEASURED against the
// tree as it stood: injecting BOTH
//
//     const forgedLiteral: Signature = { by: "Human", authority: sig.authority };
//     const forgedSpread: Signature = { ...sig, by: "Human" };
//
// into `src/blocks/artifact/fold.ts` left `tsc --noEmit` at exit 0. G1's whole
// claim — an Actor is UNREPRESENTABLE where a tool could forge one — was a
// property of who happened to write the arms.
//
// This test performs the claim instead of asserting it: it runs the REAL
// compiler, under the SHIPPED compiler settings (the fixture's tsconfig
// `extends` the project's, so the probe cannot drift into looser flags), over
// a fixture that imports the LIVE `spine/pure/actor` — no frozen copy to rot
// against, which is the failure C7's derivation actually suffered here.
//
// IT IS ALSO THE REGRESSION PIN, the analogue of the Kotlin port's
// `!signature.hasDataModifier` assertion in GateTest.kt. Revert `Signature` to
// an interface and case 1 stops erroring; swap the `#` brand for the `unique
// symbol` idiom `Authority` uses and case 2 stops erroring; drop the type-only
// import discipline and case 3 stops erroring. Each is red here first.
//
// WHAT THIS LAYER DOES NOT CLAIM. It closes SPELLING, and spelling only. A
// value the compiler accepts as a `Signature` can still be produced without
// naming the class at all — `Object.assign({}, sig, { by: "Human" })` is
// `T & U`, `structuredClone(sig)` is `T -> T`, and any user-written
// `<T>(base: T, over: Partial<T>) => T` launders the brand through a generic
// signature no brand spelling can deny. That class is closed at RUNTIME
// instead, by `Object.freeze` in the constructor and by the identity check at
// the single `verb.sign` call site (src/spine/boundary/action.ts) — see
// test/spine/stamp-residue.test.ts, which is where those three walls are
// proven. The honest claim for THIS file is "the stamp cannot be spelled",
// never "the stamp cannot be forged".
