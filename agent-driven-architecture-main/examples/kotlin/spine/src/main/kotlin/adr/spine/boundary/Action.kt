// ── spine/boundary/action — the name→ToolResult map (G1) ───────────────────
// The human path into the fold used to be unspecified: fold consumed [ToolResult],
// the surface emitted Action, and NOTHING named the conversion. This file is that
// conversion, and it is the symmetric twin of 6.8's name→Command map — both fed by
// ONE registration.
//
//     ActionResolution(registry).resolve(action, ctx) -> ToolResult   name → ToolResult
//     ActionResolution(registry).sign(result, sig, id) -> Command      name → Command
//
// Both are members of a CONSTRUCTED type, never top-level functions. A top-level
// function has no instance: nothing builds it, so nothing can stand in for it, so it
// can only be reached through whatever calls it. The registry is the state the pair
// shares, so it is constructor-held and drops out of both signatures.
//
// The Boundary builds this itself rather than receiving it injected. That is deliberate:
// an injected resolver would let a test mint ToolResults from a second site, which is
// exactly what C7 below forbids. Instantiated, therefore testable; not bound, therefore
// still the single production site.
//
// Because the open-name guard lives HERE — at the boundary, where the open name
// actually arrives — the fold has no `else` arm at all. It is exhaustive over a
// fully sealed ToolResult including Unhandled and Refused. That is 6.10's "close
// what you own; guard what you do not" put in the right place, and it is what makes
// G12's compile-time edit list total.
//
// This is also the SINGLE PRODUCTION SITE of every ToolResult in the system
// (gate check C7), so a recorded result can never disagree with what was folded.

 *
 * A NAMED seam, not a raw `(FinishedStep) -> Unit`. It lives here rather than in
 * spine/pure because its payload does, and pure may not import the boundary (C1).
 *
 * The boundary mints one of these per [Actor] value and hands each to exactly one
 * owner at wiring: the surface controller gets the human channel, the agent loop
 * and every turn get the agent one, and the serial consumer's own authored steps
 * get the spine one. A holder stamps what its channel stamps and nothing else,
 * which is what §5.3's "decided by where it entered, never by what it asks for"
 * costs to make TRUE.
 *
 * NAMED RESIDUE, because "unforgeable" would be a lie: the composition root builds
 * the boundary and therefore holds all three channels, exactly as it holds the
 * authority resolver that decides what each Actor resolves to. That is the residue
 * `spine/boundary` already has for `Signature` — the minting folder can mint. What
 * is closed is every holder that is NOT the root.
