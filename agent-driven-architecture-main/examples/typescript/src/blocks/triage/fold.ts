// ── blocks/triage/fold — the block's ARM (12.4) ────────────────────────────
// Three rules, mechanical, no exceptions:
//   1. the arm READS CURRENT STATE before it decides;
//   2. every effect push lives INSIDE the success branch;
//   3. a rejection folds a per-item Notice — never the session-global RunStatus,
//      never a mutation.
//
// The shipped reference failed all three: setPriority on an unknown ticket
// performed an Effect.Log, committed a SetPriority command, left folded state
// UNCHANGED — a clean-looking audit record for a mutation that never happened —
// and flipped the session banner to "degraded" for the rest of the session.
//
// The match is a `never`-guarded switch over the block's own sealed sub-union,
// so a new verb here fails to compile until its arm exists.
