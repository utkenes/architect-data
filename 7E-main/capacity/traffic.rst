|Capacity|.5  Traffic Engineering
-----------------------------------------

Traffic engineering (TE) for packet-switched networks is almost as old
as packet switching itself. But the term has taken on a range of
meanings over time, the only constant being that decisions about
traffic flows across a network are made based on observed traffic
patterns. One aspect of traffic engineering is about capacity planning
and provisioning. For example, when you see persistently high
utilization of a link between two sites, you might either provision a
higher speed link, or alternatively, add additional sites (and hence,
paths) to your overall network topology.

Where definitions get murky is when those kinds of activities can be
carried out in a matter of seconds or minutes due to automation, for
example, by activating a new circuit or optical wavelength, as
describe in Section |Tech|.3. As another example, techniques that
balance load across two or more equally viable paths—as we saw in
Section |Routing|.5, with the use of ECMP—is sometimes described as a
kind of traffic engineering. Routing algorithms are viewed as distinct
from traffic engineering, although deciding how to set the link
metrics used by the algorithm is usually considered an aspect of TE.

The ambiguity notwithstanding, today there is a widely accepted
interpretation of traffic engineering, focused on steering traffic
across different paths in an attempt to balance load. The key idea is
that when there is more than one path between two points in the
network, it would be best to split the traffic among those paths in a
way that avoids overloading any one of them. That simple idea has
proven challenging to implement for an equally simple reason: the
offered traffic load varies at every timescale down to the nanosecond,
while changes to the underlying link capacities and topology can be
made only at much longer timescales. Traffic loads often display daily
patterns with peak hours separated by quieter periods, but there can
also be sudden shifts in load caused by the behavior of applications
and end users. Further complicating the problem is the fact that links
or routers may fail, removing some capacity from the system.

MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) is a technology that provides a
convenient way to control the path of traffic through the network that
goes some way to address the challenges of traffic engineering. The
capability is often referred to as *explicit routing* although it has
some similarities to a feature in IP known as *source routing*.\ [#]_
:numref:`Figure %s <fig-fish>` shows an example of how the explicit
routing capability of MPLS might be applied.  This sort of network is
often called a *fish* network because of its shape (the routers R1 and
R2 form the tail; R7 is at the head).

   A network requiring explicit routing.

.. [#] IP source routing is not widely used for several reasons,
       including the fact that only a limited number of hops can be
       specified and because it is processed outside the “fast path”,
       if it is handled at all, on most routers.

Suppose that the operator of the network in :numref:`Figure %s
<fig-fish>` has determined that any traffic flowing from R1 to R7
should follow the path R1-R3-R6-R7 and that any traffic going from R2
to R7 should follow the path R2-R3-R4-R5-R7. One reason for such a
choice would be to make good use of the capacity available along the
two distinct paths from R3 to R7. We can think of the R1-to-R7 traffic
as constituting one forwarding equivalence class (FEC), and the
R2-to-R7 traffic constitutes a second FEC.  Forwarding traffic in
these two classes along different paths is difficult with normal IP
routing, because they might both contain traffic destined for the same
IP addresses. R3 doesn’t normally look at where traffic came *from* in
making its forwarding decisions.

Unlike IP, MPLS uses label swapping to forward packets. Rather than
looking at the destination address, an MPLS router looks at a label in
the packet header and makes a forwarding decision based on the value
of that label. Importantly, labels are swapped at every hop (usually)
and have local scope, unlike IP addresses. So the packets from R1 to
R7 might have label *L1* in the header when they arrive at R3, while
those from R2 to R7 have label *L2* in the header, even though both
sets of packets have the same destination. We have created two
distinct FECs, associating a different label with each FEC, and this
allows R3 to forward the traffic in the two classes differently.

One question that then arises is how do all the routers in the network
agree on what labels to use and how to forward packets with particular
labels? The short answer is that some control plane protocol handles
the task. There have actually been a few different protocols used,
included RSVP (the Resource Reservation Protocol) and extensions to
existing routing protocols. MPLS-SR (segment routing), which we saw in
the datacenter context in Chapter |Routing|, provides another set of
control plane options. For our purposes here it suffices to say that
label mappings are distributed to nodes on an explicitly specified
path (e.g., R1-R3-R6-R7) and thus set up label forwarding table
entries all along that path.  This is very similar to the process of
establishing a virtual circuit.

Once we have the mechanism of explicit routing, we can apply it to the
task of traffic engineering. The most common approach is
*constrained shortest path first* (CSPF), which is a link-state
algorithm, but which also takes various *constraints* into
account. For example, if it was required to find a path from R1 to R7
that could carry an offered load of 100 Mbps, we could say that the
constraint is that each link must have at least 100 Mbps of available
capacity. CSPF addresses this sort of problem. It works like the
SPF algorithm described in Section |Routing|.3 except that links which
don't meet the constraints, e.g., because they lack sufficient
capacity for the demand, are excluded from the calculation.

CSPF can work well, but as a distributed algorithm, it has some
weaknesses. Central planning tools are commonly used to supplement
CSPF, but the real-time management of MPLS paths is usually fully
distributed.  CSPF path calculation algorithms are triggered any time
a link changes status, or as traffic loads change, making local
choices about what seems best. This makes it nearly impossible to
achieve any sort of global optimization of resource usage, as the
example below illustrates.

Realizing the limitations of the traffic engineering approaches being
used by ISPs, some of the largest cloud operators started to look at
other ways to engineer the traffic traversing the
wide-area links between their datacenters. For example, Google has publicly
described their private backbone, called B4, which is built entirely
using bare-metal switches and SDN. Similarly, Microsoft has described
an approach to interconnecting their data centers called SWAN. A
central component of both B4 and SWAN is a centralized
Traffic Engineering control program that provisions the network
according to the needs of various classes of applications.

Consider the example in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-te-example>`. Assume
that all links are of unit capacity and we are trying to find paths
for three unit flows of traffic. In the figure on the top, Flow A is
placed first and picks one of the two shortest paths available. Flow B
is placed next and takes the shortest remaining path, as the
single-hop path is already filled by Flow A. When placing Flow C last,
there is no choice but the long path. But a central algorithm that
looked at all three flows at once and tried to place them optimally
would end up with the much less wasteful set of paths shown on the
bottom in the figure. While this is a contrived example,
sub-optimal outcomes are unavoidable when there
is no central view of traffic.

    Example of non-optimal traffic engineering (top) and optimal
    placement (bottom).

B4 and SWAN recognize this shortcoming and move the path calculation to a
logically centralized SDN controller. When a link fails, for example,
the controller calculates a new mapping of traffic demands onto
available links, and programs the switches to forward traffic flows in
such a way that no link is overloaded.

Over many years of operation, these approaches have become more sophisticated. For
example, B4 evolved from treating all traffic equally to supporting a
range of traffic classes with different levels of tolerance to delay
and availability requirements. Examples of traffic classes
included: (1) copying user data (e.g., email, documents, audio/video)
to remote datacenters for availability; (2) accessing remote storage
by computations that run over distributed data sources; and (3)
pushing large-scale data to synchronize state across multiple
datacenters. In this example, user-data represents the lowest volume
on B4, is the most latency sensitive, and is of the highest
priority. By breaking traffic up into these classes with different
properties, and running a path calculation algorithm for each one, the
team was able to considerably improve the efficiency of the network,
while still meeting the requirements of the most demanding
applications.

Through a combination of centralizing the decision-making process,
programmatically rate-limiting traffic at the senders, and
differentiating classes of traffic, Google has been able to drive
their link utilizations to nearly 100%. This is two to three times
better than the 30-40% average utilization that WAN links are
typically provisioned for, which is necessary to allow those networks
to deal with both traffic bursts and link/switch failures. Microsoft's
reported experience with SWAN was similar. These hyperscale
experiences with SDN show both the value of being able to customize
the network and the power of centralized control to change networking
abstractions. A conversation with Amin Vahdat, Jennifer Rexford, and
David Clark is especially insightful about the thought process in
adopting SDN in the cloud's backbone.
