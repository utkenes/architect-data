|Virt|.5 Microsegmentation
---------------------------------

Network virtualization has become ubiquitous in datacenters in the
years since VL2, providing an essential component of the cloud's
ability to deliver infrastructure as a service. Its use is also now
widespread in telcos and large enterprise datacenters.  One of the
interesting side-effects of this ubiquity is that it has enabled a
change in the way security is implemented.

As noted earlier in this chapter, network virtualization enables
security features such as firewalling to be implemented in a
distributed manner, in software. It also makes it relatively
straightforward to create a large number of isolated networks,
compared to the traditional approach of configuring VLANs by
hand. These two factors combined to lead to the idea of
*microsegmentation*.

Microsegmentation stands in contrast to traditional approaches to
segmenting networks, in which large sets of machines
connect to a *zone* with firewalls placed between zones. Firewalls are
a type of security appliance that is configured to selectively block
some subset of the traffic passing through it.

:numref:`Figure %s <fig-firewall>` shows a firewall protecting the
flow of traffic from an untrusted zone (the greater Internet) to a
trusted zone (a company network). The figure illustrates a common
configuration, with a firewall placed in a strategic point such as the
ingress/egress point to an enterprise network or datacenter. Of
course, unlike a physical firewall that blocks everything in its path,
a network firewall is really a sort of packet filter that makes
decisions about exactly what traffic is allowed to pass through it.

   A firewall filters packets flowing between a site and the rest of the
   Internet.

Historically, a firewall has been implemented as an “appliance”: a
dedicated system with one job, filtering packets. Firewalls have also
been provided as a set of features available on a router, and a
“personal firewall” may be implemented on an end-user machine.
Firewalls are usually configured to allow or disallow traffic based on
IP addresses, port numbers, and sometimes other information such as
the URL of an HTTP request.

Firewalls are used not just at the perimeter of a network as in
:numref:`Figure %s <fig-firewall>`, but are also placed between zones
within an enterprise or a datacenter. But with firewalls being
physical appliances that need to be configured, it is common to have
just a few of them and to divide the network into large zones.  This
makes for simple network configuration, but it also means that lots of
machines end up in the same zone even when there is no need for them
to communicate. Furthermore, the complexity of firewall rules tends to
grow over time as more and more rules would need to be added to
describe the traffic allowed to pass from one zone to another.


The key insight is that network virtualization allows for the creation
of microsegments, which are narrowly defined virtual networks that
determine both which machines can communicate with each other and how
they can do so. A microsegment is a lightweight
construct created in software.  An operator can define the precise
communication policy to be applied to a small number of virtual
machines or containers, and the SDN system implements that policy. A
microsegment can be isolated from all other microsegments, and the
rules for communication among machines connected to that microsegment
can be precisely defined and implemented using distributed
firewalling, described in Section |Virt|.4.

For example, a three-tier application is a common structure in which
one tier of VMs face the Internet, a second tier implements some
application logic, and a third tier stores data for the application. A
single three-tier application can have
its own microsegmentation policy which says that the machines in the
Internet-facing tier of the application can talk to the machines in the
application tier on some set of specified ports, but that Internet-facing
machines may not talk to each other. This is a policy that was
difficult to implement in the past, because all the Internet-facing
machines would sit on the same network segment.

Prior to microsegmentation, the complexity of configuring segments or
zones was such that machines from many applications would likely sit
on the same segment, creating opportunities for an attack to spread
from one application to another. The lateral movement of attacks
within datacenters, often between machines that had no need to
communicate normally, has been well documented as a strategy of
successful cyberattacks over many years.

Consider the arrangement of VMs and the conventional firewall in
:numref:`Figure %s <fig-standard-firewall>` from the previous
section. Suppose that, without network virtualization, we wanted to
put VM A and VM B in different segments and apply a firewall rule for
traffic going from VM A to VM B. We would have to configure two VLANs
in the physical network, connect A to one of them, and B to the other
(so A and B can't directly communicate), and then configure the
routing such that the path from the first VLAN to the second passes
through the firewall. If at some point VM A was moved to another
server, we'd have to make sure the appropriate VLAN reached that
server, connect VM A to it, and ensure that the routing configuration
was still forcing traffic through the firewall. This situation is
admittedly a little contrived, but it demonstrates why
microsegmentation was effectively impossible before the arrival of
network virtualization.

Microsegmentation has become an accepted best practice for datacenter
networking, providing a starting point for "zero-trust"
networking. This illustrates the far-reaching impact of network
virtualization, one of the key use cases of SDN.

.. takeaway::
   Zero-trust networking is often cited as an application of the
   *principle of least privilege*, which was one of a number of
   principles of computer security proposed by Saltzer and Schroeder
   in 1975. The principle states: “Every program and every user of the
   system should operate using the least set of privileges necessary
   to complete the job.” A common example of this principle in
   practice is to avoid running any process as root on Unix-like
   systems unless absolutely necessary. In the context of networking,
   it implies that applications which access the network should only
   have access to the set of resources needed to do their jobs.
