## 1. Objective

Introduce three complementary mechanisms to close the spec tracking gap in UDS:

1. **AI-driven spec assessment at commit time** — the `/commit` command evaluates whether the change needs a spec
2. **`/sdd-retro` command** — retroactively create lightweight specs for untracked changes
3. **Orphan spec detection** — find specs stuck in non-terminal states

These features are inspired by principles from GSD (state tracking), PAUL (no orphan plans), and CARL (context-aware loading).

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Behavior

- CLAUDE.md states "emergency hotfixes must document retroactively" but provides no mechanism
- `feat`/`fix` commits can land without any spec reference
- Specs can remain in Draft/Approved/Implemented states indefinitely with no warning

### Desired Behavior

- `/commit` proactively suggests spec creation/linkage based on change characteristics
- `/sdd-retro` scans git history and generates lightweight retroactive specs
- `check-orphan-specs.sh` flags specs in non-terminal states during pre-release checks

## 3. Requirements

| ID | Description | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| REQ-001 | `/commit` evaluates spec need based on type, scale, and API impact | P0 |
| REQ-002 | Custom reference footer convention documented in commit-message standards | P0 |
| REQ-003 | `/sdd-retro` scans git log and generates retroactive specs for untracked feat/fix commits | P1 |
| REQ-004 | `check-orphan-specs.sh` detects non-Archived/non-Stable specs, integrated into pre-release check | P1 |

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Commit Spec Assessment

**Given** a user runs `/commit` with staged changes
**When** the changes include `feat` or `fix` type, modify >3 files, or change public API signatures
**Then** the AI outputs a spec tracking suggestion (create new / link existing / not needed)
**And** the user can accept or ignore the suggestion

### AC-2: Custom Reference Footer Convention

**Given** the commit-message standard
**When** a commit relates to a spec or tracked document
**Then** the footer includes `Refs: PREFIX-ID` format (e.g., `Refs: SPEC-XXX`)
**And** this convention is documented in `commit-message-guide.md` and `.standards/commit-message.ai.yaml`

### AC-3: Retroactive Spec Command

**Given** a user runs `/sdd-retro`
**When** the git history contains feat/fix commits without `Refs: SPEC-` in their message
**Then** the command groups related commits and generates retroactive spec templates
**And** the user can confirm before writing to `docs/specs/`

### AC-4: Orphan Spec Detection

**Given** spec files exist in `docs/specs/`
**When** `check-orphan-specs.sh` runs
**Then** specs with Status not in (Archived, Stable) are reported
**And** the script exits with code 0 (warning only, non-blocking)

### AC-5: Pre-release Integration

**Given** `pre-release-check.sh` is executed
**When** orphan specs exist
**Then** orphan spec count is displayed as a warning (not a failure)

## 5. Files Changed

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `skills/commands/commit.md` | Modify | Add spec tracking assessment step |
| `skills/commands/sdd-retro.md` | Create | New retroactive spec command |
| `.standards/commit-message.ai.yaml` | Modify | Add spec-reference-footer rule |
| `core/commit-message-guide.md` | Modify | Document custom reference footer |
| `scripts/check-orphan-specs.sh` | Create | Orphan spec detection (macOS/Linux) |
| `scripts/check-orphan-specs.ps1` | Create | Orphan spec detection (Windows) |
| `scripts/pre-release-check.sh` | Modify | Add orphan spec check |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Modify | Update spec tracking documentation |

## 6. Test Plan

- [ ] `/commit` with feat type shows spec suggestion
- [ ] `/commit` with docs type does not show spec suggestion
- [ ] `/sdd-retro` scans history and produces grouped output
- [ ] `check-orphan-specs.sh` detects Draft status specs
- [ ] `check-orphan-specs.sh` passes when all specs are Archived
- [ ] `pre-release-check.sh` includes orphan check as step 16
