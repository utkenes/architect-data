// ── app/assemble — THE THREE TOTAL DISPATCHERS (G12) ────────────────────────
//   fold            results → (State, Attributed[])  the only decider
//   project         State   → ViewModel              the Presenter (6.9)
//   projectContext  State   → Context                the reasoner's input (G15)
//
// Three, not one: they consume different things (results / slices / slices) and
// 6.9 forbids fusing the fold with the projections.
//
// EXHAUSTIVENESS, TWICE. `foldOne` closes over `outcome` with a `never` guard;
// `foldOk` closes over BLOCK OWNERSHIP with a `never` guard. TypeScript has no
// sealed sub-hierarchies, so the second one is a chain of type predicates
// rather than a `switch` — but the property is the same and it is enforced the
// same way: add a block's result type to `app/contract`'s union without adding
// its branch here and the build fails on `const _never: never = r`.
//
// Note what is NOT here: a per-VERB branch. Adding a verb touches four sites,
// all four inside its own block folder, and zero at the root (16.1, §11.1).
