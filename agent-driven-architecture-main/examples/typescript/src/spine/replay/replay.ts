// ── spine/replay/replay — a LIVE run against its REPLAY (G9) ───────────────
// The shipped harness folded the same in-memory array twice through a pure
// function and asserted the two were equal. That is f(x) == f(x): true by
// definition, and measured to catch nothing — an impure tool that read a
// mutable global and performed a side effect passed it, because the harness
// never invoked a tool at all.
//
// What replays here is the COMMITTED BYTES, and what they are compared against
// is what a LIVE boundary actually did:
//
//   refold(initial, records, dispatchers)     re-derive state + the FULL keyed
//                                             effect sequence, timestamps and
//                                             keys included, from the bus alone
//   stateAtStep(..., k)                       THE SCRUB: the same re-fold over
//                                             the PREFIX ending at k — what the
//                                             system believed at that moment
//   collectPerform(..., mode)                 drive the perform seam in REPLAY
//                                             (collect, touch nothing) or in
//                                             RECOVERY (re-drive, deduped)
//   contextDivergence(...)                    re-derive each step's context
//                                             digest and compare it to the
//                                             fixture the step committed
//
// What REPLAY buys, exactly (14.1.1): determinism over a RECORDED TIMELINE —
// forensics, audit, production-traces-as-fixtures. NOT behavioural
// reproducibility: re-running the model is not deterministic, and inputs that
// were conflated away were never recorded. What IS guaranteed is that the run
// that WAS recorded re-derives exactly, bit for bit, from its own committed
// bytes.

// ── SNAPSHOT — a memoized fold prefix, and a tag that can REFUSE (14.1) ────
// Folding from genesis on every restart, scrub or recovery is O(timeline), and
// the deployments this architecture most recommends — a server agent, an
// ambient assistant — run indefinitely. 14.1's steel note gives the
// purity-preserving extension and its equation:
//
//     fold(snapshot@k, timeline[k..])  ==  fold(initialState, timeline)
//
// …and the rule that keeps it honest: tag every snapshot with the REDUCER
// VERSION and the TIMELINE OFFSET it covers, because a snapshot taken under an
// old reducer is untrustworthy under a new one (14.7).
//
// A TAG THAT IS ONLY CARRIED IS DECORATION — and an integer cannot police
// itself. Take the ONLY resume site a STORED snapshot permits: a reader holds a
// snapshot blob and a log, and nothing else in this system knows which prefix
// that blob covers, because `StepRecord` carries no step index. So the reader
// must ask the log for the tail at `snapshot.tag.offset`, and any check of the
// form `tag.offset === tail.from` is then `x === x`. Corrupt the integer and
// the wrong tail folds into a plausible answer. That is MEASURED, not feared:
// against a first draft of this file, seven of seven corrupted offsets resumed,
// one of them returning a state equal to the live boundary's with a committed
// effect silently dropped.
//
// So the extent is checked by CONTENT, and the two halves have two authors:
//
//   · `tag.coveredThrough` — the mark of the last record the prefix ACTUALLY
//     folded, copied off that record when the snapshot was minted.
//   · `tail.follows` — the mark of the record the LOG finds immediately before
//     the tail it hands back, read from its own bytes at resume time.
//
// Two sources, one fact. Hand the resume a corrupted offset and the log answers
// with a DIFFERENT record's mark, so the seam disagrees instead of folding.
//
// The bare offsets are still compared, and that check is not redundant: it is
// the one that catches a snapshot whose literal was misfiled against a tail
// somebody ELSE selected — the case where the two numbers genuinely do have two
// authors. It is a cheap second opinion, not the load-bearing one.
//
// WHAT THIS SEAM CANNOT SEE, said here rather than left for a reader to
// discover. The mark discriminates two offsets only when the two records
// DIFFER, and nothing in this reference guarantees that:
//
//   · two records with the same `now` AND the same rendered context are one
//     fact to this seam, so a drift between exactly those two offsets resumes.
//     Both halves earn their place against that — the Kotlin session has a
//     pair whose contexts render identically and are separated only by the
//     clock; freeze the clock and its mark separates 7 of 8. Measured, pinned
//     in both suites, and not closed.
//   · two DIFFERENT logs whose boundary records are byte-identical are
//     likewise indistinguishable.
//   · a tag forged CONSISTENTLY — offset and mark moved together — is a
//     forgery of the snapshot's own provenance that no tag field can catch.
//
// A deployment that needs more than this gives the log a per-record identity
// the reference does not mint; that is a store's job, and the store is
// product-owned (16.2).
//
// The tail stays an ARGUMENT rather than something `refoldFrom` slices out of a
// whole timeline, because 14.1's steel note says compacting below a snapshot
// trades away the ability to scrub or fork before that point: a resume that
// demanded the whole log could not run in the deployment that note exists for.
// A compacting store persists its boundary mark; the in-memory reader below
// computes it from the records it still holds.
//
// The snapshot stays a DERIVED CACHE: nothing here appends, and the timeline
// can always rebuild it. WHERE a snapshot is STORED, and how far below one a
// deployment may compact, remain product policy (16.2).
