"""Slot-time and workload analysis — the BigQuery compute-consumption curve (R17).

``WorkloadAnalyzer`` reads the workload from ``INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS`` (live,
``analyze_from_api``) or an exported query-log JSON file (``analyze_from_file``) over a
lookback window, and derives a Slot Time utilization curve: average / P50 / P99 / peak
concurrent slots plus an active-hour fraction (idle vs busy). The result grounds the AWS
compute estimate (R18) in real utilization.

Scale note (2026-07-08, deep audit): the live path reads HOURLY aggregates
(``jobs_query.read_jobs_hourly`` — ≤ 24×days rows) rather than per-job rows. Every curve
metric was already derived from hourly buckets or grand sums, so aggregating server-side
removes the multi-GB row stream a busy Source produced (the 10 PB-scale OOM risk). The
file path accepts BOTH formats: legacy per-job entries (``creation_time`` key) are
bucketed client-side; hourly-aggregate entries (parseable ``hour_bucket`` value, as
written by the metadata exporter) pass straight through.

Billed-basis policy (single rule, every input shape): a bucket is billed-carrying iff
every job it summarizes that ACTUALLY SCANNED BYTES carried a non-NULL
``total_bytes_billed`` — tracked as ``missing_billed_jobs`` on each bucket (NULL column
value live; absent key in a file entry). Any missing scan-carrying job degrades the
window to the processed-bytes fallback (a labelled overestimate, never a silent
underestimate). No-scan jobs (NULL/0 ``total_bytes_processed`` — materialized-view
auto-refreshes, DDL, errored queries) are exempt: they bill nothing, so their NULL billed
column carries no signal, and counting them degraded whole production windows off the
billed basis (2026-07-14 finding: a handful of MV refreshes among 238K billed-carrying
jobs). Intentional behavior change from the per-job era, which counted NULL billed as $0
on the billed basis: under capacity (reservation) pricing GCP documents
total_bytes_billed as "informational only" — the value is untrustworthy regardless of
whether it arrives as NULL, 0, or a non-billable number — so such a Source now degrades
honestly instead of reporting a genuine-looking $0 scan volume.

Returns ``SlotUtilization | None``: ``None`` (never a zeroed struct, never raised) when there
is no usable workload — empty job set, missing ``bigquery.jobs.listAll`` (api), or a
missing/empty/malformed file. That ``None`` is what trips the LOW-confidence cost *range*
downstream (R18.4 / P22); a zero-struct would silently defeat it.

Metric definitions (deterministic; SCRUM_NOTES § Issue 5.2):
- ``days_sampled`` = distinct UTC dates carrying a slot-bearing job.
- ``avg_slots`` = ``total_slot_ms / (days_sampled * 86_400_000)`` — mean concurrency over the
  active-day window.
- per-hour slot series over ``[first, last]`` active hour with idle hours zero-filled; ``p50``
  / ``p99`` are percentiles of that series, ``peak`` its max. Bursty load ⇒ low P50, high peak.
- ``active_hour_fraction`` = ``busy_hours / (days_sampled * 24)`` clamped to ``[0, 1]``
  (busy = hour buckets with slot_ms > 0) — the over-provisioning signal R18 reads.

Slot *concurrency* is a per-hour bucket average (``slot_ms / 3.6M``): JOBS carries no per-job
duration, so instantaneous concurrency is not recoverable — documented approximation.
