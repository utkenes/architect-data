// ── spine/pure/step-record — THE unit of commit and THE unit of replay (G9) ─
// The shipped reference committed a PAIR — append(signedCommands, results) —
// with no clock on it. Measured consequence: a live boundary folded at
// now = 1001 and its re-fold produced at = 0. Every timestamp was lost, and in
// any domain where `now` lands in State, the state was lost outright.
//
// So the commit is the STEP, not the pair. Every field earns its place:
//   schemaVersion  which shape the rest of the record is in (14.7) — the
//             envelope, so a log written across deployments is self-describing
//   now       without it a re-fold cannot reproduce what a live boundary wrote
//   sig       the stamp the fold was given
//   staged    the ordered off-bus input fixture this step consumed (5.4)
//   actions   what was ASKED — the audit half G1 named
//   results   POST-GATE — exactly what was FOLDED (so a refusal re-folds
//             without calling the authorization seam again: G9)
//   commands  the signed record, with ids that cannot be re-derived
//   context   promptVersion + the rendered digest the model saw (G15)
//
// THE SCHEMA ENVELOPE (14.7). `schemaVersion` is REQUIRED and typed as the
// LITERAL current version, so the compiler is the enforcement layer twice over:
// the boundary cannot commit a record without stamping one, and a HISTORICAL
// record — `StepRecordV1` below — is not a `StepRecord` at all and cannot be
// handed to `refold`. Upcasting is the only way in, which is exactly what 14.7
// asks for: never touch history (14.1); transform an old record into the
// current shape on the way into the fold.
//
// BOTH HALVES OF THE OLD RECORD ARE REFUSED, and the second half is the one a
// structural language makes easy to get wrong. The ENVELOPE half is this file's
// literal type. The PAYLOAD half belongs to the block: a historical payload has
// to CONFLICT with `ToolResultBase` on a member, or TypeScript's structural
// assignability would let it be spread by hand into a current-shape record and
// re-folded — a v2 envelope over v1 payloads, which is precisely the state the
// envelope exists to make unrepresentable. The triage block spells that
// conflict as `outcome: "ok-v1"`; see its contract for why a marker property
// would not have worked.
