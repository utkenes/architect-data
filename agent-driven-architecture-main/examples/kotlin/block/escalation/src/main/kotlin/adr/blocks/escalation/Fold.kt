// ── blocks/escalation/fold — the block's ARM ───────────────────────────────
// Exactly two closed matches, and each buys a different guarantee:
//
//   `when (result)` over the block's sealed sub-union — SITE 4 of the four a NEW VERB
//       touches (§11.1). Adding a verb fails to compile until it lands here.
//   `when (status)` over TicketStatus — SITE 1 OF 3 a new STATE VARIANT touches
//       (§11.2). Adding `Archived` fails to compile until it lands here, and in the two
//       matches in Project.kt. Nowhere else in the system names TicketStatus at all.
//
// the review's measured (12.4) bugs lived in this arm's ancestor:
//   confirm with NO prior Request (ticket Open) → PageOncall fired, status Escalated
//   confirm on a ticket absent from State       → PageOncall("nope") fired AND run → Degraded
// Both are structurally impossible now: the gate refuses the first before the fold ever
// sees it, and the arm reads state before it decides for the second.
//
// Derived from blocks/triage/fold, and the same rule applies: the arm is a member of a
// CONSTRUCTED type, and `reject` is a PRIVATE member of the one arm that uses it rather
// than a file-scope helper nothing owns. The constructor is empty because every
// argument varies per call.
