// ── blocks/triage/tools — the Verb table ───────────────────────────────────
// One row per verb: name, model-facing description, input schema, the PURE run,
// the name→Command entry, and the reversibility classification. There is no
// default classification — you pick a sealed variant, which is how 14.3's
// default-deny becomes structural instead of remembered.
//
// The tool returns RAW INPUTS ONLY. It does not read state to compute
// `supersedes`, does not stamp an actor, and does not decide whether the
// transition is legal — the fold does all three (4.3's division of labour).
//
// The input schema for `ticket` is a plain string ON PURPOSE (6.10): the ticket
// set is OPEN at the boundary, and the ARM is what validates it against State.
//
// THE UPCASTER LIVES HERE, and not in contract.ts, because check C7 puts it
// here: a block mints its own ToolResults in this file and nowhere else, and
// `upcastSetPriority` produces one. The v1 SHAPE is declared next to the v2
// shape it evolved from (contract.ts); the LIFT is a production site.

 *
 *  Pure and total: every v1 result has exactly one v2 form. It never touches
 *  the record it came from — the caller gets a NEW value on the way into the
 *  fold, which is the difference between upcasting and the history rewrite
 *  14.1 forbids.
 *
 *  It re-mints `outcome` and `tool` rather than spreading `old`, which is not
 *  ceremony: the v1 payload's `outcome` is `"ok-v1"` — the conflict that makes
 *  a historical payload un-foldable — so the current shape has to be written
 *  out, and this function is the one place in the port that may write it. */
