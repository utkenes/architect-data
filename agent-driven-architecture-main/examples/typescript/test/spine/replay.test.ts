// ── G9 — a LIVE run against its REPLAY, not a fold against itself ──────────
//
// MEASURED against the shipped reference: seam 07 §D's own named violation (a
// tool reading a mutable global and performing a side effect) was injected, the
// world was mutated between runs, and `replayTest` PASSED — the tool's
// side-effect count never moved, because `foldAll` never invoked a tool. The
// old harness asserted f(x) == f(x), which seam 07 §C itself calls true by
// definition.
//
// What is asserted here is what a live boundary DID against what its committed
// bytes re-derive: state, and the FULL keyed effect sequence including every
// timestamp.
