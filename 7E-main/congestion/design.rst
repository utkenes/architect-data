|CC|.1 Design Issues
------------------------------

Chapter |Capacity| outlines part of the design space for congestion
control, focusing on what routers may (or may not) do to help manage
congestion; e.g., isolate flows, perform active queue management, send
explicit congestion notifications.  There are other questions that
only the sources of those packets can answer. We start by identifying
what those questions are, and exploring the options available to TCP
(and other transport protocols running on edge hosts) to address
them. Until we get to domain-specific use cases in Section
|CC|.4, you can assume the routers implement FIFO queues with
tail-drop.

Note while the concepts underlying congestion control algorithms are
protocol-independent, the history of congestion control in the
Internet is strongly tied to TCP.\ [#]_ This includes several
implementation details that leverage existing TCP header fields. This
chapter uses this TCP-centric terminology, but as we will see in
Chapter |Message|, other transport protocols—most notably QUIC—adapt
these algorithms to their particular circumstances.

.. [#] Not only is congestion control historically tied to TCP, it's
   actually tied to a specific implementation of TCP. Originally, the
   *Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)* implementation of Unix was
   considered the *reference implementation* of TCP congestion
   control. In fact, the initial algorithm proposed by Jacobson and
   Karels was a noteworthy feature of the Tahoe release of BSD 4.3
   in 1988.  Today, Linux is has replaced BSD as the *de facto*
   reference implementation of TCP.

|CC|.1.1 Load Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At its core, congestion control is networking's version of a general
system problem: *load control*. No matter how sophisticated or
simple-minded a system's scheduler—the algorithm that decides how to
allocate system resources to users—there is a complementary question
of how many users are allowed into the system in the first place. One
answer is that there is no load control mechanism; if you show up and
want service, you get to compete for resources.

This is what leads to congestion, and anyone who has driven on a
highway at rush hour has experienced it. There is a limited
resource—the space on the highway—and a set of cars, trucks, etc. that
compete for that resource. As rush hour gets underway, more traffic
arrives but the road keeps working as intended, just with more
vehicles on it. But there comes a point where the number of vehicles
becomes so large that everyone has to slow down (because there is no
longer enough space for everyone to keep a safe distance at the speed
limit) at which point the road actually becomes *less effective* at
moving vehicles. So, just at the point when you would be wanting more
capacity, there is actually less capacity to move traffic.

This is the situation depicted in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-collapse>`,
and while the right side of the load curve is labeled *congestion
collapse*, the general shape of the graph is the same in any system
with finite resources. A multi-user computer system trying to allocate
resources to an excessive number of tasks faces a similar
problem. Perhaps the most familiar example today is trying to purchase
tickets to a popular concert from a web site, or attempting to
download the latest release of a popular game. If there isn't enough
capacity to handle the load, the service degrades in an ungraceful
manner.

.. _fig-collapse:
.. figure:: congestion/figures/Slide1.png

   :align: center

   As load increases, throughput rises then falls at the point of
   congestion collapse.

The reason that congestion collapse occurred in the early Internet is
that dropped packets are not just discarded and forgotten. When the
end-to-end transport protocol is TCP, as it is for most Internet
traffic, a dropped packet is retransmitted. So as congestion rises,
the number of retransmitted packets rises; in other words, the number
of packets sent into the network increases even if there is no real
increase in the offered load from users and applications. More packets
lead to more drops leading to more retransmissions and so on. You can
see how this leads to collapse.

A useful term in this context is *goodput*, which is distinguished
from throughput in the sense that only packets doing useful work are
counted towards goodput. So, for example, if a link is running at 100%
utilization, but 60% of the packets on that link are retransmitted due
to earlier losses, you could say the goodput is only 40%.

The solution is to somehow limit the load. On a multi-user computer
system there might be a centralized "gate" that decides to let new
users log in, but a centralized strategy is not practical on a network
the scale of the Internet. Each sender has to decide for itself
whether to send one packet, ten packets, or several gigabytes worth of
packets at any given time. In a network, the decision is ongoing
rather than a one-time gate, so it can be restated as deciding how
many bytes may be in transit in any given period of time. For ongoing
connections, you know your recent history. This is a good place to
start, but you need a heuristic to tell you if you should try to go
faster (because the network has unused capacity), or if there are
warning signs that perhaps you should slow down. For new connections,
you need a heuristic to tell you how aggressively you can start
dumping packets into the network at the start.

As an aside, since we have already seen the idea of *flow control*, it
is important to distinguish between flow control and congestion
control. Flow control involves keeping a fast sender from overrunning
a slow receiver. Congestion control, by contrast, is intended to keep
a set of senders from sending too much data *into the network* because
of lack of resources at some location. These two concepts are often
confused; as we will see, they also share some mechanisms. (Note that
in principle congestion control algorithms are protocol independent,
but in practice, they have been integrated into TCP, and so we present
them in that context.)


|CC|.1.2 Signals from the Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sender's decision to increase or decrease its sending rate is
based on different signals it detects or explicitly receives. There
are several types of signals, but the most important is the arrival of
an ACK, indicating that one of its packets has been received by the
destination. If the destination received the packet, it must have
exited the network, meaning there should now be capacity for another
packet. By using ACKs to pace the transmission of packets, TCP is said
to be *self-clocking*.  In contrast, a timeout signals that a packet
was lost, potentially implying that the network is congested, and that
TCP needs to reduce its sending rate. Because using packet loss as a
signal means congestion has already occurred and we are reacting after
the fact, we sometimes refer to this approach as *control-based*, or
alternatively, *loss-based*.

Waiting for packet loss to signal the onset of congestion, and then
reacting to that loss, is not the only option. It is possible adopt a
more proactive strategy, for example, by watching for changes in the
measured throughput rate, and adjusting the sending rate *before*
congestion becomes severe enough to cause packet loss.  Such
algorithms are said to be *avoidance-based*, or alternatively, either
*delay-based* or *rate-based*. Delay and rate are directly related, in
that the sender records how much data is successfully sent during some
time interval, such as its current estimate of the RTT. The key is
whether the observed round-trip delay is shrinking or growing. Note
that while we sometimes differentiate between the two approaches a
control-based versus avoidance-based, we always refer to the general
concept as "congestion control". The following two sections
describe various loss-based and delay-based algorithms, respectively.

|CC|.1.3 Fairness and Stability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While we want good throughput and low delay, there are other
requirements. Two topics of particular importance when thinking about
congestion avoidance are *fairness* and *stability*. When the network
is congested, it's going to be necessary for some users or flows to
send less. It is clearly worth asking: which flows should send less?
Should all flows share the pain equally? And what happens if some
flows pay more attention to congestion signals than others? These
questions are at the heart of the fairness issue. Jain's *fairness
index* is one widely accepted way to measure how
fair a network is.

When several flows share a particular link, we would like for each
flow to receive an equal share of the bandwidth. This definition
presumes that a *fair* share of bandwidth means an *equal* share of
bandwidth. But equal shares may not equate to fair shares.  Should we
also consider the length of the paths being compared? For example, as
illustrated in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-path-len>`, what is fair when
one four-hop flow is competing with three one-hop flows?

.. _fig-path-len:
.. figure:: congestion/figures/Slide10.png
   :width: 550px
   :align: center

   One four-hop flow competing with three one-hop flows.

Assuming that the most fair situation would be one in which all flows
receive the same bandwidth, networking researcher Raj Jain proposed a
metric that can be used to quantify the fairness of a
congestion-control mechanism. Jain’s fairness index is defined as
follows. Given a set of flow throughputs

.. math::

   (x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots , x_{n})

(measured in consistent units such as bits/second), the following
function assigns a fairness index to the flows:

.. math::

   f(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots ,x_{n}) = \frac{( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}
   )^{2}} {n  \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2}}

The fairness index always results in a number between 0 and 1, with 1
representing greatest fairness. To understand the intuition behind this
metric, consider the case where all *n* flows receive a throughput of
1 unit of data per second. We can see that the fairness index in this
case is

.. math::

   \frac{n^2}{n \times n} = 1

Now, suppose one flow receives a throughput of :math:`1 + \Delta`.
Now the fairness index is

.. math::

   \frac{((n - 1) + 1 + \Delta)^2}{n(n - 1 + (1 + \Delta)^2)}
   = \frac{n^2 + 2n\Delta + \Delta^2}{n^2 + 2n\Delta + n\Delta^2}

Note that the denominator exceeds the numerator by :math:`(n-1)\Delta^2`.
Thus, whether the odd flow out was getting more or less than all the
other flows (positive or negative :math:`\Delta`), the fairness index has
now dropped below one. Another simple case to
consider is where only *k* of the *n* flows receive equal throughput,
and the remaining *n-k* users receive zero throughput, in which case the
fairness index drops to \ *k/n*.

.. sidebar:: Fairness vs. Deployment

   Over the decades of development of congestion control, algorithms,
   the question has often arisen of whether a given mechanism A is
   fair to flows managed by mechanism B. If mechanism A is able to
   measure improved throughput over B, but it does so by being more
   aggressive, and hence, stealing bandwidth from B's flows, then A's
   improvement is not fairly gained and may be discounted. The
   Internet's highly decentralized approach to congestion control
   works because a large number of flows respond in a cooperative way
   to congestion, which opens the door to more aggressive flows
   improving their performance at the expense of those which implement
   the accepted, less aggressive algorithms.

   Arguments like this have been made many times, which has raised a
   high bar to the deployment of new algorithms. Even if global
   deployment of a new algorithm would be a net positive, incremental
   deployment (which is the only real option) could negatively impact
   flows using existing algorithms, leading to a reluctance to deploy
   new approaches. But such analysis suffers from three problems, as
   identified by Ranysha Ware and colleagues (see Further Reading below):

   * **Ideal-Driven Goalposting:**
     A fairness-based threshold asserts that new
     mechanism B should equally share the bottleneck link with
     deployed mechanism A. This goal is too idealistic in
     practice, especially when A is sometimes unfair to its own
     flows.

   * **Throughput-Centricity:**
     A fairness-based threshold focuses on
     how new mechanism B impacts a competitor flow using mechanism A
     by focusing on A’s achieved throughput.  However, this ignores
     other important figures of merit for good performance, such as
     latency, flow completion time, or loss rate.

   * **Assumption of Balance:**
     Inter-mechanism interactions often
     have some bias, but a fairness metric cannot tell whether the
     outcome is biased for or against the status quo. It makes a
     difference in terms of deployability whether a new mechanism B
     takes a larger share of bandwidth than legacy mechanism A or
     leaves a larger share for A to consume: the former might elicit
     complaints from legacy users of A, where the latter would
     not. Jain’s Fairness Index assigns an equivalent score to both
     scenarios.

   Instead of a simple calculation of Jain's fairness index, Ware
   advocates for a threshold based on *harm*, as measured by a
   reduction in throughput or an increase in latency or
   jitter. Intuitively, if the amount of harm caused by flows using a
   new mechanism B on flows using existing mechanism A is within a
   bound derived from how much harm A-managed flows cause other
   A-managed flows, we can consider B deployable alongside A without
   harm. Even with a single congestion control algorithm, the amount
   of harm that one flow causes another depends on factors such as its
   RTT, start time, and duration. Thus measures of harm need to take
   into account the range of impacts that different flows have on each
   other under the existing regime and aim to do no worse with a new
   algorithm.

Stability is another critical property for any sort of control system,
which is what congestion control is. When congestion is detected, some
action is taken to reduce the total amount of traffic, causing
congestion to ease, at which point it would seem reasonable to start
sending more traffic again, leading back to more congestion. You can
imagine that this sort of oscillation between congested and
uncongested states could go on forever, and would be quite detrimental
if the network is swinging from underutilized to collapsing.  We
really want it to find an equilibrium where the network is busy but
not so much so that congestion collapse occurs. Finding these stable
control loops has been one of the key challenges for congestion
control system designers over the decades. The quest for stability
features heavily in the early work of Jacobson and Karels and
stability remains a requirement that subsequent approaches have to
meet.

Finally, much of the theoretical work on congestion control frames the
problem as

  *"a distributed algorithm to share network resources among competing
  sources, where the goal is to choose source rate so as to maximize
  aggregate source utility subject to capacity constraints."*

Formulating a congestion-control mechanism as an algorithm to optimize
an objective function is traceable to a paper by Frank Kelly in 1997,
and later extended by Sanjeewa Athuraliya and Steven Low to take into
account both traffic sources (TCP) and router queuing techniques
(AQM). We do not pursue the mathematical formulation outlined in these
papers (and the large body of work that followed), but we do find it
helpful to recognize that there is an established connection between
optimizing a utility function and the pragmatic aspects of the
mechanisms described in this chapter.
