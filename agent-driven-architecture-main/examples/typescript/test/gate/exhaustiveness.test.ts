// ── G12 / §15.4 — adding a variant BREAKS THE BUILD, and only there ──
//
// MEASURED against the shipped reference: adding
//   | { readonly kind: "Archived"; readonly at: number }
// to TicketStatus left `tsc --noEmit` at exit 0 and 8/8 tests passing, because
// `projection.ts:30-31` discriminated with `t.status.kind === "Open"` instead of
// a closed, never-guarded match. 15.4's central promise — "the compiler hands
// you the edit list" — was false at the one place a reader would check it.
//
// This test performs the promise instead of asserting it: it copies the real
// source tree, applies a shipped patch fixture, runs the real compiler, and
// requires a non-zero exit naming EVERY consumer and nothing outside the block.
//
// FOUR FIXTURES RIDE IT:
//
//   extra-ticket-status   a fifth STATE VARIANT   → 3 sites, all in blocks/escalation/
//   novel-effect-kind     a second EFFECT KIND    → 2 sites: the owning block's
//                         handler table, and the GATE's own totality ledger
//   owns-under-claim      a block's `owns` DROPS a case its union declares
//   owns-over-claim       a block's `owns` ADDS a case its union does not
//
// The last two are the pair that closes the one authoring site this port used to
// leave unguarded. `owns` is derived from a claim table that is a mapped type
// over the block's own result union, so the two ways a predicate could drift are
// a missing property and an excess one — each proven must-fail here, each inside
// the block's own folder. They are the COMPILER's half; the half no type can
// state (that the union still matches the verbs the block REGISTERS) is the
// ownership census in test/app/totality.test.ts.
//
// THE MEASUREMENT PROGRAM IS THE GATE'S OWN PROGRAM, and that is the whole of
// this harness's second revision. It used to compile `include: ["src"]` with
// `exclude: ["**/*.test.ts"]` — strictly narrower than `tsc --noEmit`, whose
// program is `["src", "test", "eslint.config.js"]`. A cost that moved into a test
// file was therefore invisible to the instrument that reported the cost, which is
// the one thing an instrument may never be. The copy below carries `test/` and
// the gate config, and mirrors the real `exclude` list verbatim, so
// `outOfFolder` below is a number about the gate rather than about this file's
// own field of view.
//
// THE PACKAGE FARM IS LOAD-BEARING. Since the workspace wall, `src/app` reaches a
// block through the bare specifier `@adr/block-triage/register`, which node
// resolves through `node_modules`. A copy without its own `@adr` links resolves
// every cross-package import back to the REAL tree — so the patch would be
// invisible to `app/` and `spine/`, and "zero sites outside the folder" would be
// true by construction rather than by measurement. The farm below points every
// `@adr/*` at the COPY, which is what makes the outside-the-folder count a real
// number. Everything else (`valibot`, `ai`, `@types/node`, `typescript-eslint`)
// still resolves upward to the project's own `node_modules`.
//
// Manual proof, one command: add `Archived` to TicketStatus in
// `src/blocks/escalation/slice.ts` and run `npm run typecheck`. Expect three
// errors, in `blocks/escalation/fold.ts` and `blocks/escalation/project.ts`.
