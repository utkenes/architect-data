# Deployment Standards Specification
# 部署規範規格書

**Feature ID**: CORE-DEPLOY-001
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

This specification defines the design decisions and acceptance criteria for the Deployment Standards core standard (`core/deployment-standards.md`). It addresses the gap in UDS coverage between code quality gates (checkin-standards) and production operations, providing guidance on safe, progressive deployment practices.

本規格定義部署規範核心標準的設計決策與驗收條件，補齊 UDS 在程式碼品質關卡（checkin-standards）與生產環境運維之間的缺口。

---

## Motivation

### Problem Statement

1. UDS covers code quality (checkin-standards), testing (testing-standards), security (security-standards), and performance (performance-standards), but has **no guidance on how to safely deploy code to production**
2. Missing coverage areas: staging validation, canary/progressive deployment, feature flags lifecycle, rollback criteria, and environment consistency (Dev/Prod parity)
3. Teams adopting UDS have no standard reference for deployment strategy selection or DORA metrics targets

### Solution

Add a new core standard `deployment-standards.md` that:
- Defines deployment strategy selection criteria (Rolling, Blue-Green, Canary, Feature Flag)
- Establishes feature flag lifecycle management
- Provides rollback decision matrices and procedures
- Ensures environment consistency following Twelve-Factor App principles
- Includes pre/post-deployment checklists
- References DORA metrics for measuring deployment effectiveness

---

## User Story

```
As a development team adopting UDS,
I want clear deployment standards and checklists,
So that I can deploy code safely, roll back quickly when needed,
and measure deployment effectiveness with industry-standard metrics.
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Core Principles

**Given** a team reading the deployment standard
**When** they review the Core Principles section
**Then** they find 6 principles: Deploy ≠ Release, Progressive Exposure, Quick Rollback, Environment Parity, Automate Everything, Monitor Everything

### AC-2: Deployment Strategy Selection

**Given** a team choosing a deployment strategy
**When** they consult the strategy selection matrix
**Then** they can compare Rolling, Blue-Green, Canary, and Feature Flag strategies across dimensions: use case, rollback speed, resource cost, and complexity

### AC-3: Feature Flags Lifecycle

**Given** a team using feature flags
**When** they follow the feature flags lifecycle section
**Then** they understand 4 flag types (Release, Experiment, Ops, Permission), 4 lifecycle stages (Create, Enable, Monitor, Cleanup), and tech debt management rules

### AC-4: Rollback Strategy

**Given** a deployment showing degraded metrics
**When** the team consults the rollback section
**Then** they find automatic trigger conditions (Error Rate, p95, Health Check), manual trigger scenarios, P1-P4 decision matrix, and 3 rollback methods

### AC-5: Environment Consistency

**Given** a team managing multiple environments
**When** they follow the environment consistency section
**Then** they find Twelve-Factor App Factor X reference, 3 gap types (Time, Personnel, Tools), and a 4-category checklist (Infrastructure, Application, Data, Configuration)

### AC-6: Pre-Deployment Checklist

**Given** a team preparing for deployment
**When** they use the pre-deployment checklist
**Then** they have ~30 items across 7 categories: Code Quality, Security, Performance, Database, Config & Deps, Deployment Readiness, Communication

### AC-7: Post-Deployment Checklist

**Given** a team that has just deployed
**When** they follow the post-deployment checklist
**Then** they have tasks organized into 4 time phases: Immediate (<5min), Short-term (<1hr), Medium-term (<24hr), Long-term (<1wk)

### AC-8: DORA Metrics

**Given** a team wanting to measure deployment effectiveness
**When** they review the DORA Metrics section
**Then** they find 4 KPIs (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time, Change Failure Rate, MTTR) with Elite/High/Medium/Low benchmarks

### AC-9: Cross-References

**Given** the deployment standard is published
**When** checking related core standards
**Then** at least 5 existing standards (security, performance, testing, checkin, changelog) contain cross-references to deployment-standards.md

### AC-10: AI YAML

**Given** the deployment standard is published
**When** checking `.standards/` directory
**Then** a `deployment-standards.ai.yaml` file exists with token-optimized format covering strategies, feature_flags, rollback, environment_parity, dora_metrics, and checklist sections
