# Industry Testing Pyramid

> **Language**: English | [繁體中文](../../locales/zh-TW/options/testing/industry-pyramid.md) | [简体中文](../../locales/zh-CN/options/testing/industry-pyramid.md)

**Parent Standard**: [Testing Completeness](../../core/test-completeness-dimensions.md)

## Overview

The industry testing pyramid is a pragmatic 4-level testing model used by agile and DevOps teams. It emphasizes fast feedback through many unit tests, moderate integration tests, system tests for subsystem validation, and minimal end-to-end tests.

## Best For

- Agile/Scrum development teams
- CI/CD focused environments
- Small to medium projects
- DevOps practices
- Rapid iteration cycles

## The Pyramid

```
    ┌─────────┐
    │   E2E   │  ←  3% (Slow, expensive)
    ├─────────┤
    │   ST    │  ←  7% (Medium speed)
    ├─────────┤
    │   IT    │  ← 20% (Fast)
    ├─────────┤
    │   UT    │  ← 70% (Very fast, many)
    └─────────┘
```

**Target Ratio:** 70/20/7/3 (UT/IT/ST/E2E)

**Note:** Empirical recommendation by Mike Cohn, not a mandatory standard.

**Rationale:**
- More unit tests = faster feedback
- Fewer E2E tests = lower maintenance cost
- Integration tests catch interface issues
- System tests validate subsystem behavior with stubbed externals

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing (UT) - 70%

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Definition** | Isolated tests for individual functions, methods, or classes |
| **Scope** | Single function/method/class |
| **Speed** | < 100ms per test |
| **Dependencies** | All mocked |

**Characteristics:**
- Fast execution
- Deterministic results
- No I/O operations
- Tests single unit of behavior

### Integration Testing (IT) - 20%

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Definition** | Tests for component interactions and data flow |
| **Scope** | Multiple components interacting |
| **Speed** | < 1 second per test |
| **Dependencies** | Mix of real and mocked |

**Characteristics:**
- Tests real integrations
- May use containers (Testcontainers)
- Validates data flow

### System Testing (ST) - 7%

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Definition** | Tests complete subsystem with stubbed external dependencies |
| **Scope** | Complete subsystem validation |
| **Speed** | < 10 seconds per test |
| **Dependencies** | Real internal services, stubbed external APIs |

**Characteristics:**
- Validates subsystem behavior end-to-end
- Stubbed external dependencies
- Tests in SIT environment

### End-to-End Testing (E2E) - 3%

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Definition** | Tests complete user workflows across entire system |
| **Scope** | Full user flows from user perspective |
| **Speed** | 30 seconds to minutes per test |
| **Dependencies** | All real |

**Characteristics:**
- Simulates real user behavior
- Tests critical paths only
- Highest maintenance cost

## Coverage Targets

| Metric | Minimum | Recommended |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Line Coverage | 70% | 85% |
| Branch Coverage | 60% | 80% |
| Function Coverage | 80% | 90% |

## Tools by Level

### Unit Testing

| Language | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| JavaScript | Jest, Vitest, Mocha |
| Python | pytest, unittest |
| Java | JUnit, TestNG |
| C# | xUnit, NUnit, MSTest |
| Go | testing package, testify |

### Integration Testing

| Language | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| JavaScript | Supertest, Testcontainers |
| Python | pytest, Testcontainers |
| Java | Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers |
| C# | WebApplicationFactory, Testcontainers |

### E2E Testing

| Language | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| JavaScript | Playwright, Cypress, Puppeteer |
| Python | Playwright, Selenium |
| Java | Selenium, Playwright |

## When to Choose Industry Pyramid

**Choose when:**
- Practicing Agile/Scrum methodology
- CI/CD pipeline is critical
- Fast feedback is priority
- Team is small and cross-functional
- Minimal documentation overhead desired

**Avoid when:**
- Need formal QA certification
- Enterprise compliance requirements
- Dedicated QA team prefers ISTQB
- Audit documentation is required

## Comparison with ISTQB

| Industry Level | ISTQB Equivalent | Note |
|----------------|------------------|------|
| Unit Testing (UT) | Component Testing | Same concept |
| Integration Testing (IT) | Integration Testing | Same concept |
| System Testing (ST) | System Testing | Same concept |
| E2E Testing | Acceptance Testing | Industry E2E ≈ ISTQB Acceptance |

## Rules

| Rule | Description | Priority |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Follow pyramid ratio | Target 70/20/7/3 ratio for UT/IT/ST/E2E (empirical, not mandatory) | Required |
| Test at lowest level | Write tests at the lowest level that provides confidence | Recommended |
| Avoid E2E for edge cases | Use unit tests for edge cases, not E2E | Recommended |
| Integration for boundaries | Use integration tests to verify interface contracts | Recommended |
