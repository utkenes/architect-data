|Stream|.1 Design Issues
-----------------------------------------------

The idea of sending real-time media over packet networks goes back at
least to the 1980s, when researchers at Bellcore built an "Etherphone"
that transmitted a 64kbps audio stream—captured using something that
looked exactly like a 1980s telephone handset—over an Ethernet. Since
the backbone of the Internet in those days was only 56kbps, it would
be a few more years before this technology found its way to the
Internet. And only in the late 1990s did the bandwidths available
across the Internet start to make "voice over IP" feasible.

Today, of course, audio and video make up a large fraction of the
Internet's traffic. But there is more to the story than just Internet
link bandwidths catching up with the demands of multimedia
applications. We highlight four major issues.

First, the coding and compression of audio and video content presents
an interesting study in how humans process information. There is a
*lot* of information in high-resolution video, for example, but a much
of it is either redundant or of limited value when perceived by a
human eye. An example of redundant content is the unchanging
background of a video. If we can send the background once and then say
"don't make any changes to the background" that requires a lot less
bandwidth than sending the same background image at 30 frames per
second. The hard part is to algorithmically determine which part of the
image isn't changing, and that is one thing that modern video coding
does.

Similarly, images contain both high and low spatial frequency
information, and the human eye is more sensitive to the lower
frequency information. Thus, we can allocate more bandwidth to
transmitting the information that has more value to the human eye.

Compression of video and audio, therefore, depends on an understanding
of human perception, and there have been decades of research on how to
optimize compression while maintaining high perceived
quality. Compression also has to take account of the fact that
networks will occasionally lose data; this means that you can't afford
to completely remove redundant information, or one lost packet might
render the entirety of a video useless to the recipient.

The second issue concerns the transport protocol. When sending
real-time media across networks, it soon becomes apparent that the
reliable byte-stream model of TCP isn't suitable because of the
potentially unbounded delay of waiting for the retransmission of lost
packets. A single packet loss is often preferable to a long
delay. While this might lead one to assume that UDP would be a better
choice, that leaves a lot of work up to the application. A simple
example is conveying timing information from one participant to
another so that audio and video tracks can be synchronized. It could
be done by the application, but it is a common enough problem that
it's helpful to have a transport protocol that takes care of this
task. Identifying those useful common tasks and building them into a
real-time transport led to the development of RTP (Real-time Transport
Protocol).

Third, since many real-time applications involve two or more humans
conversing with each other, many such applications are a poor fit to
the client-server model of communication, in which the client makes a
request to a well-known server. The problem of how to bring
participants together in a *session* and how to communicate all the
information (such as the chosen coding standards) among participants
is known as *session control*. Solving these issues has give rise to a
set of protocols designed specifically for applications connecting
sets of participants rather than clients making requests of servers.

The fourth issue is a familiar one: how to scale the system. While
most of us have been on large video conferences that seem to work
well, the solution normally depends on some high-capacity cloud
service to send the video out to the participants. The problem of how
to distribute real-time media to large audiences—imagine a world-wide
audience watching the World Cup—is gaining renewed attention and we
conclude the chapter by looking at an approach which aims to be as
scalable as today's delivery of entertainment video using DASH.

We conclude by drawing attention to what has turned out to be a
non-issue.  For many years it seemed obvious that supporting
latency-sensitive traffic for applications like VOIP and video
conferences would require in-network mechanisms to avoid excessive
queuing delays. Chapter |Capacity| described a number of approaches to
queuing that have been developed so that some traffic can receiver
lower delay even when the overall load is high. However, for much of
today's Internet, those mechanisms are not deployed; the solution has
simply been to deploy enough capacity that delay is mostly acceptably
low. So far, this approach has worked.
