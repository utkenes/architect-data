// Support for the C7 fixture. The variant lists C7 denies are DERIVED from this
// file, never enumerated in the rule — which is why adding a verb stays four
// appends (§11.1) and never touches the gate.
//
// Sealed CLASSES, exactly like the live contracts. The first version of this
// fixture stayed interface-style when the live tree migrated to sealed classes:
// the derivation went vacuous on the LIVE tree while the fixture kept the
// block-test green — a fixture that stops sharing the tree's shape stops
// standing in for it, which is the silent rot 15.2 exists to deny.
