// ── spine/pure/staged — the OFF-BUS INPUT fixture, sealed (5.4, 10.2, 11.2) ─
// Everything a step consumed that did NOT come off the bus, in the order it was
// staged. Two kinds, and they differ in exactly one way that matters: where the
// text came from. NEITHER IS TRUSTED.
//
//   Perceived   10.2 — content a sensor, an inbox or a webhook perceived.
//   Recalled    11.2 — a PEER TIER's published conclusion, fetched through the
//                      relay. A suggestion, never a command. It carries no
//                      Authority, and there is no field on it that could carry
//                      one, so recall confers no authority BY CONSTRUCTION.
//
// G12, expressed natively: a shared base interface declares `source` ONCE, the
// union is closed here, and every consumer matches it with a `never` guard.
//
// WHY THE RECALL OUTCOME IS A SEALED SET AND NOT A NULLABLE STRING. "The deep
// tier has not published yet" and "the deep tier is slow and this is what we
// held last" are different facts with different consequences, and a caller that
// cannot tell them apart will eventually present stale as fresh. Three variants,
// three `never`-guarded consumers (`renderStaged` below, plus the analysis
// block's view row and context line), so a fourth cannot slip past.
//
// WHY `publishedAt` AND NOT A PRE-COMPUTED `age`. An age captured at read time
// is a SECOND clock reading, unrecorded, and it would diverge on every re-fold.
// `publishedAt` is a value that travels; the age is DERIVED at the consuming
// step (`ageOf`) from the one clock read the boundary already makes. That keeps
// "`clock.now()` is the only clock read in the system" literally true, and makes
// the age deterministic under replay.
