// ── THE BOOK STATES ARCHITECTURE; EVIDENCE LIVES BESIDE THE CODE ──────────
//
// docs/DECISIONS.md:142 moved §17.4's exercised/specified table out of the
// book. The ladder stays as architecture; which rungs a codebase has actually
// climbed is that codebase's own claim, made in its own README where a build
// settles it. docs/DECISIONS.md:147 is what makes the move checkable at all:
// any sentence in `wiki/` whose truth depends on the current state of
// `examples/` is a port-fact.
//
// THE MOVE FIRST SHIPPED WITHOUT AN INSTRUMENT, WHICH IS WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.
// The counterexample was not subtle. Restore the removed "EXERCISED VERSUS
// SPECIFIED-BUT-UNPROVEN" note verbatim, flatten its four cross-reference `<a>`
// elements to the bare-number spelling the book already uses elsewhere, and
// every link census in `citations.test.ts` is unchanged to the occurrence while
// the book claims again that every rung "is now exercised by the accompanying
// ports". Three gates green over a complete relapse. Those pins were never
// reading the evidence; they were reading the links that happened to sit inside
// it, and flattening the links is a two-minute edit.
//
// SO THE CENSUS READS THE CLAIM, IN TWO FAMILIES, AND BOTH ARE LOAD-BEARING.
//
//   PORT-FACT — the FORM a port-fact takes rather than a list of names: a
//   REFERENT ("the reference ports", "both ports", "per port", "in-memory
//   adapters", "the accompanying code"), a PATH (`examples/typescript/…`,
//   `.github/workflows/…`), or a TOOL (`npm test`, `./gradlew check`, detekt,
//   vitest, ast-grep, eslint). Enumerating the spellings one removed paragraph
//   happened to use is how a rule gets defeated by the next synonym, so each
//   alternative is a shape with its optional articles and its path tail.
//
//   EVIDENCE-VERDICT — the words a verdict is rendered in at all: "exercised",
//   "partly", "specified but unproven", "proven", "unproven", "demonstrates",
//   "ships", "goes green". This half is what closes the evasion. A relapse
//   worded "every rung is demonstrated by the code that ships alongside this
//   document, and the suites are green" names no port, no path and no tool, and
//   passes the port-fact family with zero hits.
//
// REGION-ANCHORED AS WELL AS WHOLE-FILE. A whole-file count on its own is paid
// for by moving an occurrence in from elsewhere in the same file — the
// NO-INFLATION lesson `dependency-rule.test.ts` already records — so §17.4 is
// sliced out and pinned at its own value with the book's total pinned beside
// it. Neither is an inequality; a relapse that also deletes an unrelated
// sentence to keep the total flat still moves the region.
//
// AND ONE DENIAL THAT IS STRUCTURAL RATHER THAN LEXICAL. §17.4's ladder table
// has THREE columns. The evidence lived in a fourth. A reworded fourth column
// is denied by its shape whatever it manages to say, and that is the only
// assertion here a rewrite cannot argue with.
//
// SCOPED TO wiki/index.html, DELIBERATELY. docs/DECISIONS.md:142 is
// book-scoped; docs/DECISIONS.md:147's sweep is wiki/-scoped and larger.
// `wiki/example/05-ports-and-swap.html`, `06-blocks-and-root.html`,
// `07-replay-and-advanced.html` and `wiki/example/index.html` carry
// pre-existing port-facts that belong to that sweep, not to this file — and one
// of them is a load-bearing needle in `roster-count.test.ts`, so a wiki/-wide
// census landed here would either go red on arrival or force that needle's
// deletion, silently emptying a shipped vacuity roster. Left open on purpose.
//
// HONEST BOUND, in the idiom of `dependency-rule.test.ts`'s census note: a
// grep-class instrument over prose cannot close a claim tipped by a word in
// NEITHER family, and review at §17.4 owns that residue. What IS closed is the
// class the counterexamples came from — every referent, path and tool spelling
// the removed text used, every verdict word it rendered, and the table shape no
// wording can route around.
//
// NOT AN INVARIANT, AND DELIBERATELY NOT ON THE ROSTER, exactly as
// `dependency-rule.test.ts` declares itself: this mints no G-id, adds no
// `laws.toml` row, is not a rostered check (the registry requires every one to
// trace to a law, and this traces to none) and does not move the roster's N.
// It is a pin test in the citation-floor idiom — the cheapest medium that fails
// loudly.
//
// WHY IT LIVES HERE. `test/laws` is the ONE citation-exempt path
// (`SKIPPED_PATHS` in `citations.test.ts`) and `test/laws/fixtures` is skipped
// by roster-count's walker, so neither this file nor its fixtures can move a
// per-root citation pin or join the roster corpus. The price is that the
// citation lint cannot SEE this file: the retired-namespace law still binds
// here, and every reference above is hand-written as `docs/DECISIONS.md:<line>`
// for that reason.
