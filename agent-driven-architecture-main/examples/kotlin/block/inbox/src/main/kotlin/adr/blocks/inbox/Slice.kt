// ── blocks/inbox/slice — what load-shedding LOOKS LIKE, as folded state ────
// 12.2: a busy-drop must be OBSERVABLE, NEVER SILENT. That sentence is only true if
// the drop lands somewhere a human and the model can both see, which means it is
// product state: a slice, a view, a context projection and a blast radius. That is
// the definition of a block (4.5–4.7), which is why the counters live here and not
// in the spine.
//
// Copy-on-write; never mutate the input.
