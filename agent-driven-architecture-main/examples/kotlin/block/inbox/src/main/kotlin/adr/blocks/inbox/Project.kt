// ── blocks/inbox/project — TWO pure projections of the SAME slice ──────────
// slice → view    what a human reads      (6.9)
// slice → lines   what the reasoner reads (G15)
//
// THE SECOND ONE IS WHAT MAKES "OBSERVABLE, NEVER SILENT" MEAN SOMETHING. A counter
// only an operator can see tells the agent nothing; a context line tells the
// REASONER it is shedding load, so it can decide to be terser, batch, or ask for
// help. 12.2's requirement is not "log the drop", it is "the drop is visible where
// decisions are made" — and both places where decisions are made get told.
//
// Bounded by the same constant every other block uses, so a storm of drops cannot
// inflate the prompt.
