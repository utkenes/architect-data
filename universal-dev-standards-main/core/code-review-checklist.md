## Purpose

This standard provides a comprehensive checklist for reviewing code changes, ensuring quality, maintainability, and consistency before merging.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Be Respectful**
   - Review code, not the person
   - Assume good intentions
   - Be constructive, not critical

2. **Be Thorough**
   - Check functionality, not just syntax
   - Consider edge cases
   - Think about future maintenance

3. **Be Timely**
   - Review within 24 hours (or team SLA)
   - Don't block progress unnecessarily
   - Prioritize unblocking others

4. **Be Clear**
   - Explain WHY, not just WHAT
   - Provide examples when suggesting changes
   - Distinguish blocking vs. non-blocking comments

## Review Comment Types

Use these prefixes to clarify comment intent:

### Comment Prefixes

| Prefix | Meaning | Action Required |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **❗ BLOCKING** | Must fix before merge | 🔴 Required |
| **⚠️ IMPORTANT** | Should fix, but not blocking | 🟡 Recommended |
| **💡 SUGGESTION** | Nice-to-have improvement | 🟢 Optional |
| **❓ QUESTION** | Need clarification | 🔵 Discuss |
| **📝 NOTE** | Informational, no action | ⚪ Informational |

### Example Comments

```markdown
❗ BLOCKING: Potential SQL injection vulnerability here.
Please use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: This method is doing too much (120 lines).
Consider extracting validation logic to a separate method.

💡 SUGGESTION: Consider using a Map here instead of an array for O(1) lookup.
Not critical, but could improve performance if list grows large.

❓ QUESTION: Why are we using setTimeout here instead of async/await?
Is there a specific reason for this approach?

📝 NOTE: This is a clever solution! Nice use of reduce here.
```

> This comment prefix approach aligns with the [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) specification, which standardizes review feedback across teams and tools.

### Alternative: Text Labels

For teams preferring plain text labels without emojis:

| Label | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `[REQUIRED]` | Must fix before merge | 🔴 Required |
| `[SUGGESTION]` | Recommended but not blocking | 🟡 Recommended |
| `[QUESTION]` | Need clarification | 🔵 Discuss |
| `[NIT]` | Minor suggestion, can ignore | 🟢 Optional |
| `[PRAISE]` | Positive feedback | ⚪ Informational |

**Example Comments**

```markdown
[REQUIRED] Potential SQL injection vulnerability here.

[SUGGESTION] Consider using StringBuilder for better performance.

[QUESTION] What's the intended behavior when input is null?

[NIT] Variable name could be more descriptive.

[PRAISE] Elegant solution! Nice refactoring.
```

## Review Automation

### Automated Checks (CI/CD)

Configure these checks to run automatically:

```yaml
# Example: GitHub Actions
name: PR Quality Checks

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Build check
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      # Test check
      - name: Tests
        run: npm test -- --coverage

      # Linter check
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint

      # Security check
      - name: Security Audit
        run: npm audit --audit-level=high

      # Coverage check
      - name: Coverage Report
        run: |
          coverage=$(npx nyc report | grep 'Lines' | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')
          if (( $(echo "$coverage < 80" | bc -l) )); then
            echo "Coverage $coverage% below 80%"
            exit 1
          fi

      # Complexity check
      - name: Complexity Check
        run: npx eslint src --ext .js,.ts --max-warnings=0
```

---

## Code Review Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Nitpicking Style Without Auto-Formatting

**Problem**: Spending review time on formatting issues
**Solution**: Use automated formatters (Prettier, Black, etc.)

---

### ❌ Approving Without Reading

**Problem**: Rubber-stamp approvals
**Solution**: Actually review the code, or decline to review

---

### ❌ Being Vague

**Bad**: "This doesn't look right"
**Good**: "Line 45: This condition will always be true because X. Consider Y instead."

---

### ❌ Blocking on Personal Preferences

**Bad**: "I don't like ternary operators, please use if-else"
**Good**: "💡 SUGGESTION: You could use if-else here for clarity (personal preference)"

---

### ❌ Not Explaining WHY

**Bad**: "Change this"
**Good**: "Change this because it creates a memory leak when the array grows beyond 10k items"

---

### ❌ Reviewing Too Much at Once

**Problem**: 500+ line PRs are hard to review thoroughly
**Solution**: Break large changes into smaller PRs

---

## Review Time Guidelines

### Target Response Times

| PR Size | Initial Response | Complete Review |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| < 50 lines | 2 hours | 4 hours |
| 50-200 lines | 4 hours | 1 day |
| 200-500 lines | 1 day | 2 days |
| > 500 lines | 🚨 Consider splitting | 3+ days |

> **Sources & configurability**: the size tiers reflect the empirically observed
> drop in review effectiveness past ~200–400 changed lines (SmartBear/Cisco code
> review study; [Google engineering practices](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/)).
> The response-time targets are UDS defaults — replace them with your team's
> review SLA. **Exception**: generated or vendored bulk changes (lockfiles,
> migrations, snapshots) are reviewed by spot-check, not by line count.

### Reviewer Availability

- Set "review hours" in team calendar
- Use GitHub/GitLab "away" status when unavailable
- Assign backup reviewers for urgent PRs

---

## Special Cases

### Hotfix Reviews

- **Expedited process**
- Focus on: correctness, security, rollback plan
- Skip: minor style issues, nice-to-have optimizations
- **Post-merge review** allowed for critical issues

---

### Dependency Updates

- Check CHANGELOG for breaking changes
- Verify test pass
- Review security advisories
- Consider automated with Dependabot/Renovate

---

### Documentation-Only Changes

- Check for accuracy
- Verify formatting (Markdown, etc.)
- Ensure examples are runnable
- Lighter review acceptable

---

### Refactoring PRs

Refactoring changes require special attention to ensure behavior is preserved while code quality improves.

#### Pre-Review Checklist

- [ ] **Scope documented**: Refactoring scope clearly stated in PR description
- [ ] **Pure refactoring**: No functional changes mixed with refactoring
- [ ] **Tests pass**: All tests pass before AND after refactoring
- [ ] **Coverage maintained**: Test coverage not decreased

#### Review Focus Areas

- [ ] **Code smells addressed**: Which smells were fixed? (Long Method, Duplicate Code, etc.)
- [ ] **Refactoring pattern correct**: Was the appropriate technique applied?
- [ ] **Naming improved**: Are new names meaningful and consistent?
- [ ] **Complexity reduced**: Is the code measurably simpler? (Consider cyclomatic complexity)
- [ ] **Coupling reduced**: Are dependencies cleaner?

#### Large Refactoring (>500 lines changed)

- [ ] **Plan documented**: Link to refactoring plan or design doc
- [ ] **Incremental commits**: Each commit is reviewable independently
- [ ] **Rollback strategy**: How to revert if issues arise?
- [ ] **Performance assessed**: Any impact on runtime performance?
- [ ] **Characterization tests**: Legacy code protected by behavior-capturing tests

#### Red Flags

- ❗ **New features hidden**: Functional changes disguised as refactoring
- ❗ **Test behavior changed**: Assertions modified rather than preserved
- ❗ **Missing documentation**: No explanation of what changed or why
- ❗ **Unrelated changes**: Formatting fixes mixed with logic refactoring

#### Best Practices

- Prefer **multiple small PRs** over one large refactoring PR
- Use **[Refactor]** prefix in PR title for easy filtering
- Include **before/after** code snippets or complexity metrics
- Reference the **code smell** being addressed (e.g., "Fixes Long Method in UserService.process()")
