// ── app/wire — the SINGLE composition root (G7) ────────────────────────
// Exactly one file may know what is real and what is faked in a build. Removing
// it means a service locator, which G7 forbids.
//
// Plugging a block in is: its `register(...)` line here, its `handlers(...)`
// contribution to the dispatcher below, its slice field in app/contract, its
// three union memberships there, and its branch in each of app/assemble's three
// dispatchers. Pulling it out is the same list, subtracted, plus
// `rm -rf src/blocks/<X>/`. Every one of those is an APPEND to a closed set —
// but the compiler does NOT name each one you forget, and an earlier version of
// this sentence said it did. The compiler names the sites that ride an
// exhaustive union: the slice field and the three dispatcher branches. The
// `register(...)` line is not one of them — a block left out of the registry
// simply is not there, and the program compiles perfectly well without it. That
// omission is caught a layer later, by the registry-totality check (C13), which
// is precisely why that check exists rather than being redundant with the
// compiler. The Kotlin port's README states the same split in its own words.
//
// THE HANDLER SPLIT: a NEW EFFECT KIND appended to a block's EXISTING effect
// union is not on that list any more. It costs its case in the owning block's
// contract and its handler in that block's registration — both inside the
// folder — and NOTHING here. A block growing its FIRST effect kind is the one
// exception: it also costs one compiler-named line in this file's dispatcher
// assembly, exactly the "handful of appends, every one compiler-named" headline
// the decisions record ratifies for the blast-radius table (docs/DECISIONS.md:125;
// review proved the universal zero with the console case). This
// file names exactly one effect kind, `Diag`, which is the spine's own and
// stays the root's to perform.
//
// RECEIPT, 2026-07-30 — CLOSED 2026-08-01. Addressed to the blast-radius table the
// decisions record schedules for the book (theme 5). When this file landed, prose
// elsewhere still stated something it had made false; rewriting that prose belonged
// to a later entry rather than to this one, because a code landing does not edit the
// book ahead of its own phase. That entry has landed, and ADR-001 §1.3 Q1 records the
// deletion as performed.
//
// TWO CORRECTIONS to what this receipt originally claimed, both measured rather than
// argued. The set was FIVE prose sites, not the three enumerated here: the two it
// missed were the worked example's own blast-radius table row and this port's README.
// And all five are rewritten, so the retired claim survives nowhere — not in the book,
// not in either README, not in the ADR, and not, after this edit, in the two
// composition-root receipts that used to quote it back at themselves. Nothing here is
// outstanding, and the phase order is no longer holding anything.
//
// THE MEASURED REPLACEMENT, stated as the set the real compiler names rather
// than as a bare zero. Appending a novel kind to an existing block's effect
// union costs, in this port:
//
//   · src/blocks/<owner>/contract.ts   the case          (in folder)
//   · src/blocks/<owner>/register.ts   the handler arm   (in folder, compiler-named)
//   · test/app/totality.test.ts        the GATE's own totality ledger,
//     `EXPECTED_EFFECTS` — out of folder, and maintained per effect case EXACTLY
//     as the pre-existing verb half already is: `Record<OkResult["tool"], true>`
//     sits in that same file, twelve entries, and pre-dates this landing, so a
//     new VERB has always cost that same out-of-folder edit.
//   · test/gate/fixtures/novel-effect-kind/patch.json, when the union line it
//     quotes is the one that changed — a hard, visible failure rather than a
//     silent one.
//
// So: out-of-folder PRODUCTION sites (anything under `src/`) = 0 for kinds on
// an existing union (a FIRST kind adds one dispatcher-assembly line here), in BOTH ports,
// earned by the real compiler — not 0 sites overall. The pin that keeps that
// honest rather than asserted is test/gate/exhaustiveness.test.ts, whose
// `novel-effect-kind` fixture compiles the gate's OWN program (`src` and `test`
// together) and asserts the out-of-folder error set as an EXACT equality; the
// Kotlin half is the test-tree census in its gate's GateTest.

// ── The effect DISPATCHER: assembled here, registered by the blocks ────────
// The root's job at this seam is now assembly and binding, not branching. Each
// effect-bearing block contributes a `Handlers<XEffect>` table keyed on its own
// union's discriminant; this file spreads them into one `Handlers<Effect>` and
// adds the spine's own `Diag`.
//
// FOUR BLOCKS OF SIX contribute, and the count is a measurement rather than a
// preference. It is a fact about THIS port, not about the architecture: a
// review found this sentence quoting a `contextLines` census of 5/6 and citing
// `spine/pure/block`, which are the KOTLIN port's number and a module that
// exists only there. Measured here, all six blocks declare `contextLines`. `console` and `inbox` declare no effect cases at all, so
// a table from either would be `{}`; asking them for one would make two blocks
// pretend to a role they do not have. A block grows a handler the moment it
// grows an effect, and not before, because that is when its `Handlers<XEffect>`
// stops being satisfiable by an empty object.
//
// TOTALITY IS THE ANNOTATION. `Handlers<Effect>` is a mapped type over the
// union's own discriminant, so a kind with no handler is a compile error, here,
// before any test runs. It is checked against each block function's DECLARED
// return type, which is what keeps a NEW KIND'S error inside the block folder.
// The runtime floor in `performEffect` covers what the annotation cannot: a
// table thinned after assembly. C13's handler half watches both.
//
// REPLAY touches nothing (G9). RECOVERY re-drives; the deduping sink in front
// of it drops anything already acknowledged, keyed on the committed step index.
