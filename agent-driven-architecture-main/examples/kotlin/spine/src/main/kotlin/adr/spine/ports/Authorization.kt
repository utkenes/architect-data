// ── spine/ports/authorization — the product-owned seam (14.3, 17.1) ────────
// This is where G6's unattended confirmer becomes representable and where its per-tenant budget's
// per-tenant budget belongs. Both are enforced at the BOUNDARY, before the fold,
// and their verdict rides the committed record as an ordered G9 fixture — so a
// re-fold reproduces the decision without calling either of these again.
//
// Note what does NOT happen here: Actor does not grow a variant. The actor
// contract grows only at architecture revision, never per application — and a
// product's tenth kind of confirmer is not a revision. Authority is an opaque id,
// so it adds no type and no case.
