// ── vitest.config.ts — `.tsbuild` is a walk too, and the only DANGEROUS one ──
// The wall's declaration output is excluded from .gitignore, from eslint's
// `ignores` and from both laws walks, so nothing miscounts it. vitest differs in
// kind: a stray compiled `*.test.js` under `.tsbuild/` is not miscounted, it is
// EXECUTED. Measured — a block test compiled there ran as a 24th test file and
// failed on a module path that only resolves from `src/`.
//
// The three entries below RESTATE vitest's defaults and add one. This option
// REPLACES the default `exclude` rather than extending it, so dropping
// node_modules or dist here would lose them.
//
// `.work/**` is the SAME kind of walk for the same reason. It is the G12
// negative-compilation harness's scratch copy, and since that copy carries
// `test/` as well as `src/` it holds a duplicate of every test file in the tree.
// The harness deletes it; an ABANDONED run does not, and vitest would then
// EXECUTE the duplicates against a program that only resolves from the real root.
//
// Defence in depth, not a replacement: `exclude: ["**/*.test.ts"]` in every one
// of the fourteen package tsconfigs that declares inputs is what stops such a
// file being compiled in the first place — the three declared-empty adapter
// leaves carry no `exclude` because `files: []` admits nothing to begin with —
// and scripts/wall.mjs prunes `.tsbuild` on every run so nothing accumulates.

      // execute against this port's packages instead of its own copy of the
      // tier. Scoped to that one segment rather than to `fixtures` at large,
      // which was measured to be wrong: laws.toml's in-checker rows name test

    // contended — a gate that fails at random breeds exactly the re-run culture
