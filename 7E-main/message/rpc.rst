|Message|.2 Remote Procedure Call
---------------------------------

RPC is a popular mechanism for structuring distributed systems, based
on the semantics of a local procedure call—the application program
makes a call into a procedure without regard for whether it is local
or remote and blocks until the call returns. An application developer
can be largely unaware of whether the procedure is local or remote,
simplifying his task considerably. This is why RPC is such a
compelling abstraction.

A complete RPC mechanism actually involves two major components:

1. A protocol that manages the messages sent between the client and
   the server processes and that deals with failure modes of the
   underlying network. This protocol is sometimes referred to as an
   "RPC Protocol", but we distinguish between the overall mechanism
   and the underlying protocol by calling the latter a message
   transaction protocol.

2. Programming language and compiler support to package the arguments
   into a request message on the client machine and then to translate
   this message back into the arguments on the server machine, and
   likewise with the return value. This piece of the RPC mechanism is
   sometimes called a *stub compiler*.

:numref:`Figure %s <fig-rpc>` schematically depicts what happens
when a client invokes a remote procedure. First, the client calls a
local stub for the procedure, passing it the arguments required by the
procedure.  This stub hides the fact that the procedure is remote by
translating the arguments into a request message and then invoking an
underlying message transaction protocol to send the request message to
the server machine. At the server, the transaction protocol delivers
the request message to the server stub, which translates it into the
arguments to the procedure and then calls the local procedure. After
the server procedure completes, it returns a reply message that it
hands off to the protocol for transmission back to the client. The
protocol on the client passes this message up to the client stub,
which translates it into a return value that it returns to the client
program.

   Complete RPC mechanism.

This section considers just the network-related aspects of an RPC
mechanism, focusing on the protocol that transmits messages between
client and server. The transformation of arguments into messages and
*vice versa* is covered in Section |Message|.6. It is also important to keep
in mind that the client and server programs are written in some
programming language, meaning that a given RPC mechanism might support
Python stubs, Java stubs, GoLang stubs, and so on, each of which
includes language-specific idioms for how procedures are invoked.

The first RPC mechanism is due to Andrew Birrell and Bruce Nelson at
Xerox PARC, as described in their 1984 paper. Many other RPC
mechanisms followed their lead, often implemented as the communication
substrate for early distributed systems built around personal
workstations and Ethernet-based local-area networks. For example, the
VMTP protocol mentioned in a sidebar earlier in this chapter followed
from David Cheriton's experience implementing the Distributed V
Kernel. Also during this era, SunRPC became the *de facto* standard
thanks to its wide distribution with Sun workstations and the central
role it played in Sun’s popular Network File System (NFS). The IETF
subsequently adopted it as a standard Internet protocol under the name
ONC RPC.

The emergence of the cloud led to another seismic shift in RPC design,
in part corresponding to the wide-spread adoption of HTTP as discussed
in Chapter |Apps|. This is where we pick up the story by turning our
attention to gRPC, a popular open source RPC mechanism. gRPC is based
on an RPC mechanism that Google had been using internally to implement
cloud services in their datacenters.

.. sidebar:: RPC vs REST

   *Recall that we introduced the idea of REST and RESTful APIs in
   Chapter 2. Now that we're focused on RPC, you may be asking how
   REST and RPC are related. You will sometimes hear people talk about
   RPC versus REST, as though it's an either-or choice, but that's a
   false dichotomy. Both are based on an underlying message
   transaction protocol, whether it's HTTP, gRPC, or QUIC. The main
   distinction is the style of API you are trying to support.*

   *If it is RESTful, then you have only four remote procedures to
   worry about:* ``GET``, ``POST``, ``PUT``, *and* ``DELETE``. *The
   interesting part of the API is identifying the set of resources
   (objects) you want to operate on. An RPC-based API is not limited
   to four operations, which often means you end up supporting many
   more methods. This may be necessary so the program can support more
   complex actions, such as* ``SendEmail()``, ``ProcessPayment()``,
   *or* ``LaunchJob()``.

   *But even this distinction is a bit misleading. This is for two
   reasons.  One is obvious: you can always use a general RPC mechanism
   to implement a RESTful API; just limit yourself to four remote
   procedures. The other reason is that the claim that your API is
   "too complex" for a simple RESTful API is actually a failure of
   imagination. The two approaches are duals of each other, and you
   can always find a way to represent an "action-based" API as a
   "resource-based" API instead. API design is often a matter of
   convenience and taste, but it should be done knowing that
   both design patterns can be made to work.*

Although it was developed in Google, gRPC does not stand for Google RPC. The
“g” stands for something different in each release. For version 1.10
it stood for “glamorous” and for 1.18 it stood for “goose”. According
to the official gRPC FAQ, it is now a recursive acronym: gRPC means
“gRPC Remote Procedure Call”. gRPC has become broadly popular because it
makes available to everyone—as open source—a decade’s worth of
experience within Google using RPC to build scalable cloud services.

Before getting into the details, there is a major difference between
gRPC and other RPC mechanisms—such as SunRPC—that came before it.
The difference is that gRPC was explicitly designed for cloud services
rather than the simpler client/server paradigm that preceded it. As we
introduced in Chapter |Apps|, this results in an extra level of indirection.

In the client/server world, the client invokes a method on a specific
server process running on a specific server machine. One server
process is presumed to be enough to serve calls from all the client
processes that might call it. With cloud services, the client invokes
a method on a *service*, which, in order to support calls from
arbitrarily many clients at the same time, is implemented by a
scalable number of server processes, each potentially running on a
different server (or VM).  A *load balancer* then directs that
invocation to one of the many available server processes (containers)
that implement that service.

What we are interested in here is the transport protocol at the core of
gRPC. Here again, there is a major departure from earlier RPC
mechanisms, not in terms of fundamental problems that need to be
addressed, but in terms of gRPC’s approach to addressing them. In
short, gRPC “outsources” many of the problems to other protocols,
leaving gRPC to essentially package those capabilities in an
easy-to-use form. Let’s look at the details.

gRPC runs on top of a protocol stack as shown in :numref:`Figure %s
<fig-grpc-stack>`. Working our way up from the bottom, we can see that
gRPC runs on top of TCP, unlike many other RPC protocols, so that it
can outsource the problems of reliably transmitting request and reply
messages of arbitrary size. Second, gRPC relies on *Transport Layer
Security* (TLS), the layer that secures end-to-end TCP connections,
described in Chapter |TLS|, which means it also outsources
responsibility for securing the communication channel so adversaries
can’t eavesdrop on or modify the message exchange. Finally, gRPC
runs on top of HTTP/2, meaning gRPC outsources two further problems: (1)
efficiently encoding/compressing binary data into a message, (2)
multiplexing multiple concurrent remote procedure calls onto a single
TCP connection.

Putting all this together, gRPC encodes the identifier for the remote
method as a URI, places the request parameters to the remote method as
content in the HTTP message, and retrieves the return value from the
remote method in the HTTP response. The full gRPC stack depicted in
:numref:`Figure %s <fig-grpc-stack>` also includes the
language-specific elements that enable developers to invoke gRPC
requests.  One strength of gRPC is the wide set of programming
languages it supports, with only a small subset shown in the figure.

   gRPC core stacked on top of HTTP, TLS, and TCP and
   supporting a collection of languages.

This all means we find ourselves in an interesting dependency loop:
RPC can be viewed as a message-oriented transport protocol used to
implement distributed applications, HTTP is an example of an
application-level protocol, and yet gRPC runs on top of HTTP rather
than the other way around.

It's not that uncommon to see layering produce this sort of convoluted
result.  Layering provides a convenient way for
humans to wrap their heads around complex systems, and outsourcing
problems to an existing layer can be an efficient want to
avoid duplication of effort. However, what we’re
really trying to do is solve a set of problems (e.g., reliably transfer
messages of arbitrary size, identify senders and recipients, match
requests messages with reply messages, and so on) and the way these
solutions get bundled into protocols, and those protocols then layered
on top of each other, is the consequence of incremental changes over
time. It's easy to imagine a different outcome if the set of available
protocols at any point in time had been slightly different.

Imagine, for example, a different version of history in which the
Internet had started with an RPC mechanism as ubiquitous as TCP—see
the sidebar on VTMP in the previous section for an example. HTTP then
might have been implemented on top of that RPC layer. Google might
have spent their time improving the RPC protocol rather than inventing
one of their own in gRPC. What happened instead is that the web became
the Internet’s killer app, which meant that its application protocol
(HTTP) became universally supported by the rest of the Internet’s
infrastructure: Firewalls, Load Balancers, Encryption, Authentication,
Compression, and so on. Because all of these network elements have
been designed to work well with HTTP, HTTP has effectively become the
Internet’s universal request/reply transport protocol.

.. takeaway:: This discussion effectively illustrates an important
   point about layering. It is important to remember that layering is
   an abstraction to help us understand and modularize networks, not a
   fixed rule about what happens in any given module. Thus there is
   nothing wrong with finding that an application protocol such as
   HTTP has effectively become the transport layer for another
   application protocol running above it. More generally, every
   complex system is eventually refactored (modularized differently)
   if it's around long enough. Networks are no exception.


There is also a possibility of a different set of layers
replacing or at least coexisting with gRPC/HTTP/TCP. As we discuss
in Section |Message|.3, QUIC has been developed to be a more suitable transport for
HTTP, and part of what it offers is a better match to the
request/reply semantics of both HTTP and RPC.

Returning to the unique characteristics of gRPC, the biggest value it
brings to the table is to incorporate *streaming* into the RPC
mechanism, which is to say, gRPC supports four different request/reply
patterns:

1. Simple RPC: The client sends a single request message and the server
   responds with a single reply message. The client blocks until the
   reply is returned.

2. Server Streaming RPC: The client sends a single request message and
   the server responds with a stream of reply messages. The client
   completes (unblocks) once it has all the server’s responses.

3. Client Streaming RPC: The client sends a stream of requests to the
   server, and the server sends back a single response, typically (but
   not necessarily) after it has received all the client’s requests.

4. Bidirectional Streaming RPC: The call is initiated by the client, but
   after that, the client and server can read and write requests and
   responses in any order; the streams are completely independent.

This extra freedom in how the client and server interact means the gRPC
transport protocol needs to send additional metadata and control
messages—in addition to the actual request and reply messages—between
the two peers. Examples include ``Error`` and ``Status`` codes (to
indicate success or why something failed), ``Timeouts`` (to indicate how
long a client is willing to wait for a response), ``PING`` (a keep-alive
notice to indicate that one side or the other is still running), ``EOS``
(end-of-stream notice to indicate that there are no more requests or
responses), and ``GOAWAY`` (a notice from servers to clients to indicate
that they will no longer accept any new streams).

Unlike many other protocols in this book, where we show the protocol’s
header format, the way this control information gets passed between
the two sides is largely dictated by the underlying transport
protocol, in this case HTTP/2. For example, HTTP already includes a
set of header fields and reply codes that gRPC takes advantage of.

With HTTP's basic operation in mind, the following is fairly
straightforward. A simple RPC request (with no streaming) might
include the following HTTP message from the client to the server:

.. code-block:: html

   HEADERS (flags = END_HEADERS)
   :method = POST
   :scheme = http
   :path = /google.pubsub.v2.PublisherService/CreateTopic
   :authority = pubsub.googleapis.com
   grpc-timeout = 1S
   content-type = application/grpc+proto
   grpc-encoding = gzip
   authorization = Bearer y235.wef315yfh138vh31hv93hv8h3v
   DATA (flags = END_STREAM)
   <Length-Prefixed Message>

leading to the following response message from the server back to the
client:

.. code-block:: html

   HEADERS (flags = END_HEADERS)
   :status = 200
   grpc-encoding = gzip
   content-type = application/grpc+proto
   DATA
   <Length-Prefixed Message>
   HEADERS (flags = END_STREAM, END_HEADERS)
   grpc-status = 0 # OK
   trace-proto-bin = jher831yy13JHy3hc

In this example, ``HEADERS`` and ``DATA`` are two standard HTTP
control messages, which effectively delineate between “the message’s
header” and “the message’s payload.” Specifically, each line following
``HEADERS`` (but before ``DATA``) is an ``attribute = value`` pair
that makes up the header (think of each line as analogous to a header
field); those pairs that start with colon (e.g., ``:status = 200``)
are part of the HTTP standard (e.g., status ``200`` indicates
success); and those pairs that do not start with a colon are
gRPC-specific customizations (e.g., ``grpc-encoding = gzip`` indicates
that the data in the message that follows has been compressed using
``gzip``, and ``grpc-timeout = 1S`` indicates that the client has set
a one second timeout).

There is one final piece to explain. The header line

.. code-block:: html

   content-type = application/grpc+proto

indicates that the message body (as demarcated by the ``DATA`` line)
is meaningful only to the application program (i.e., the server
method) that this client is requesting service from. More
specifically, the ``+proto`` string specifies that the recipient will
be able to interpret the bits in the message according to a *Protocol
Buffer* (abbreviated ``proto``) interface specification. Protocol
Buffers are gRPC’s way of specifying how the parameters being passed
to the server are encoded into a message, which is in turn used to
generate the stubs that sit between the underlying RPC mechanism and
the actual functions being called (see :numref:`Figure %s
<fig-rpc>`). This is how gRPC tackles the *argument marshalling*
problem, to which we return in Section |Message|.6.

The bottom line is that complex mechanisms like RPC, once packaged as
a monolithic bundle of software (as with SunRPC), are nowadays built by
assembling an assortment of smaller pieces, each of which solves a
narrow problem. gRPC is both an example of that approach, and a tool
that enables further adoption of the approach.  The microservices
architecture mentioned in Chapter |Apps| applies the “built from small parts”
strategy to entire cloud applications (e.g., the services provided by Uber, Lyft, Netflix,
Yelp, Spotify, etc.), where gRPC is often the communication mechanism used
by those small pieces to exchange messages with each other.
