// ── blocks/escalation/tools — the Verb table, with the gated verb ──────────
// `confirmEscalation` is `Irreversible`, and `Irreversible` CANNOT BE
// CONSTRUCTED without saying where its matching Request lives. That is 14.3's
// default-deny made structural: there is no default classification to forget,
// and the classification is a reviewed row in the registry rather than a guess.
//
// `requestedBy` reads the authority that ASKED straight off committed State —
// and it reads it from `TicketStatus`'s PARENT-DECLARED property, so it needs no
// match over the status variants and adding a fifth variant costs it nothing.
// The boundary compares that authority against the confirming one; this file
// never sees a Signature and never decides anything.
