// ── blocks/triage/contract — the block's transport ─────────────────────────
// Three sealed sub-unions, one per spine root. The block appends cases; it never
// edits the root. The sub-union is also what makes the block's fold arm exhaustive
// on its own, without naming a sibling.
//
// PACKAGE NOTE (G12, in Kotlin): this file sits in blocks/triage/ but declares package
// adr.contract, because Kotlin requires every variant of a sealed hierarchy to live
// in one package. Gate check C2 compensates: a file under blocks/X may import from
// adr.contract only the spine roots or X-prefixed symbols.
//
// HARD CONSTRAINT (G1): no *Result case has an Actor, Authority or Signature
// field. The Command cases carry `sig` — the whole stamp, minted at the boundary.

     * Every variant of a sealed hierarchy must live in one package AND one MODULE, so
     * this block's transport is authored inside `:spine` (ADR-001 §3) — the compiler
     * says "Extending sealed classes or interfaces from a different module is
     * prohibited". A payload type the transport NAMES therefore cannot stay behind in
     * the block module: `:spine` may not depend on a block at all.
     *
     * It is nested on the block's own sealed root rather than promoted to
     * `adr.spine.pure`, because the kernel is a VENDORABLE tier (gate check C15) and
     * a triage priority is block domain vocabulary — putting it there would be a
     * worse violation of "the spine tier names nothing in your feature code" than
     * anything the DAG fixes. Nested, C2 admits it by the existing name-prefix rule
     * (`TriageResult.Priority` starts with `Triage`), C15 never sees it, `adr.spine.pure`
     * gains nothing, and no new file and no new package enter the kernel.
     *
     * Consumers import the nested name — `import adr.contract.TriageResult.Priority` —
     * so the block's own files still read `Priority`.

 * with no discriminant trick required. (The TypeScript port is structural and had to
 * buy the same refusal by giving its v1 payload an `outcome` the current union does
 * not have; the two ports are equal in GUARANTEE, spelled per language.)
 *
 * The only thing that may read one is the upcaster in this block's Tools.kt — which is
 * where a block mints its results (gate check C7), and therefore the only legal home
 * for a function whose OUTPUT is one. It is declared as a sealed union with one case
 * so that C7's name-suffix derivation covers its construction too, exactly as it
 * covers [TriageResult].
 *
 * ABSENCE IS NOT `null`. A v1 record had no field at all; a v2 record with
 * `reason = null` says a caller supplied none. Those are different facts, and
 * conflating them is how an upcaster quietly invents history.
