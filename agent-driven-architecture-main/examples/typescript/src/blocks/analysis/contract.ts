// ── blocks/analysis/contract — the TIER RELAY's transport (11.2, 11.3) ─────
// Two verbs, one per tier, and they are ordinary verbs: same declarations, same
// signer, same blast radius as `setPriority`. Tiering is not a second mechanic.
//
//   recallAnalysis   FAST tier. Reads the snapshot the consumer already staged.
//   publishAnalysis  DEEP tier. Emits the one effect that writes to the relay.
//
// WHY A RECALLED CONCLUSION CANNOT REACH AN IRREVERSIBLE EFFECT (10.2, 11.3).
// Three facts, all carried by machinery that already ships:
//
//   1. It cannot carry an Authority. `Recall` declares `text` and `publishedAt`
//      and nothing else, and THIS FILE is under check C4 — a block's contract
//      may not name Actor, Authority or Signature. Unrepresentable, not unused.
//   2. It cannot become a pending request. An irreversible verb's `requestedBy`
//      returns an Authority read out of committed State; the analysis slice
//      stores text with no Authority field to return, and C4 denies importing
//      `authority` inside a block's tools, so one cannot be minted either.
//   3. The recall arm emits NO effect at all. `PublishConclusion` is emitted
//      only by `publishAnalysis` — the deep tier's own signed act.
//
// So an irreversible act SUGGESTED by recalled text still has to pass the
// boundary gate on its own merits, and with no pending request from a different
// principal it is Refused. Recall confers no authority; it buys the model
// nothing. Both halves of that are tested.
