// ── blocks/analysis/tools — the Verb table, split by TIER ──────────────────
//   recallAnalysis   FAST tier, Reversible.  Reads the staged snapshot. NO effect.
//   publishAnalysis  DEEP tier, Reversible.  Appends the note AND emits the effect.
//
// 11.4's "single registry, an allowlist of the agents permitted to exist" is these
// two TABLES plus the two lists app/wire composes from them. A fast tier wired with
// only [AnalysisTools.fastVerbs] CANNOT publish — the name is not in its registry, so
// the boundary folds an `Unhandled` rather than trusting a promise not to call it.
//
// TWO TABLES ON ONE CONSTRUCTED TYPE, over the one lens they share — the same shape
// the boundary's `ActionResolution` uses to hold its two maps over one registry. This
// is the block that breaks the "one verb table per block" pattern, and it is why
// `register` is NOT a method on the shared `Block` interface: three tier builders
// cannot be expressed as one.
//
// The recall body is PURE and TOTAL. It reads the `Recalled` the consumer already
// staged and bounded; it never touches the relay, never awaits, never fails. That is
// what makes the whole rung replay for free: the committed result carries the sealed
// `Recall`, so a re-fold resolves the same snapshot AND the same branch from bytes.
