// VIOLATION: G1, fourth half — THE DECLARING-FILE ESCAPES. The one file
// that declares the class needs no import to hold the constructor, so the
// import denial (C4_MINT) never fires here and each declaration-form
// republication below must be denied by shape, not by import path.

export default Signature;

// the subclass spelling — a second constructor whose instances pass every
// check on the first
