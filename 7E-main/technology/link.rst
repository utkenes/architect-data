|Tech|.1 Communication Links
-------------------------------------------

All network communication depends on transmitting and receiving
electromagnetic signals over some physical medium, be it radio waves
through the atmosphere or space, an electrical current over copper
wires, or light waves through optical fibers. Each signal can be
modeled as a waveform that can be transmitted within some frequency
band. Some of the available frequency bands and their uses are shown
in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-spectrum>`.

   Electromagnetic spectrum, with frequencies measured in Hertz (Hz).

The first challenge of communication is to convert a digital signal
into the available analog signal, a process known as *modulation*.
In some cases this is very simple, as in *baseband modulation*, where
a digital signal may be directly encoded as, say, high and low voltage
levels on a cable. Many forms of modulation involve modifying the
phase, amplitude, or frequency of a *carrier* at a certain frequency,
so that the signal may be transmitted in one of the frequency bands
illustrated above.


There are quite a few hard problems to be solved in mapping the
digital signal to an analog waveform, and then reversing the process
at the other end. The channel between sender and receiver will usually
*attenuate* the signal (making it weaker) and introduce noise. The
receiver has to recover the intended digital value in the face of
noise and attenuation.


The engineering required to transmit and receive digital messages over
a physical medium is non-trivial. The same is true for the
science—known as *Information Theory*\ —that explains how efficiently
that task can be performed. We consider both Information Theory and
the details of modulation techniques out of scope for this book, and
refer the reader to authoritative sources on the topic. We will,
however, come back to modulation when we look at transmitting wireless
signals in Chapter |Shared|.

That still leaves us with plenty of work to do, corresponding to what
is usually referred to as the link layer, or sometimes *Layer 2 (L2)*\
—terms originally coined by the OSI reference model presented in
Chapter |Intro|.  Another term you will often see is *Medium Access Control
(MAC)*, indicating that the focus is on controlling how the sending
and receiving nodes access a physical medium. The MAC layer is usually
implemented in a *network adaptor*, otherwise known as a *Network
Interface Card (NIC)*, plugged into a computer.

This section introduces the problems addressed by the link layer, and
uses Ethernet as its representative example. The Ethernet has
undergone significant changes since it was first introduced in the
mid-1970s, not the least of which is that it is now possible to
transmit Ethernet packets over fiber optic links at bandwidths
approaching 1-Tbps, many orders of magnitude greater than the original
2.94-Mbps rate over coaxial cable. We focus on the modern version of
Ethernet in the next three subsections, and then fill in some of the
historical background in Section |Tech|.1.4.

.. sidebar:: Ethernet Standards

   When we say "Ethernet" we are really talking about a family of
   standards, tracing back to the first specification written by
   Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Intel, and Xerox. That
   vendor-led definition, known as DIX, was subsequently standardized
   by the IEEE as 802.3. The original standard was for a solution based
   on *Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detect (CSMA/CD)*
   technology. The “carrier sense” in CSMA/CD meant that all the nodes
   were able to distinguish between an idle and a busy link, "multiple
   access" meant that multiple nodes connected to the same coax cable,
   and “collision detect” meant that nodes listen as they transmit and
   can therefore detect when a frame interferes (collides) with another
   frame.

   Over time, Ethernet was approved for different cable types (e.g.,
   twisted-pair, single-mode fiber, multi-mode
   fiber), to run at different speeds (e.g., 10Mbps, 100Mbps, 1Gbps,
   10Gbps, 40Gbps, 100Gbps, 200Gbps, 400Gbps, 800Gbps), to span
   different distances (e.g., 10 meters, 100 meters, 40 kilometers),
   and for full-duplex communication (as opposed to the original
   CSMA/CD). Each of these variants was independently standardized,
   with designations of the form 802.3xx. For the purposes of this
   book, none of these distinctions impact how the technology is
   incorporated into packet-switched networks, although we primarily
   focus on point-to-point links rather than their multi-access
   predecessors.

|Tech|.1.1 Encoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first task is to encode the binary data that the source node wants
to send into the signals that the physical links are able to carry and
then to decode the signal back into the corresponding binary data at
the receiving node. Ignoring the details of modulation, and assuming
just two discrete signals (high and low) for the time being, the
obvious thing to do is to map the data value 1 onto the high signal
and the data value 0 onto the low signal. This is exactly the mapping
used by an encoding scheme called *non-return to zero* (NRZ).  For
example, :numref:`Figure %s <fig-nrz>` schematically depicts the
NRZ-encoded signal (bottom) that corresponds to the transmission of a
particular sequence of bits (top).

.. _fig-nrz:
.. figure:: technology/figures/f02-04.png
   :width: 400px
   :align: center

   NRZ encoding of a bit stream.

The problem with NRZ is that a sequence of several consecutive 1s means
that the signal stays high on the link for an extended period of time;
similarly, several consecutive 0s means that the signal stays low for a
long time. There are two fundamental problems caused by long strings of
1s or 0s. The first is that it leads to a situation known as *baseline
wander*. Specifically, the receiver keeps an average of the signal it
has seen so far and then uses this average to distinguish between low
and high signals. Whenever the signal is significantly lower than this
average, the receiver concludes that it has just seen a 0; likewise, a
signal that is significantly higher than the average is interpreted to
be a 1. The problem, of course, is that too many consecutive 1s or 0s
cause this average to change, making it more difficult to detect a
significant change in the signal.

The second problem is that frequent transitions from high to low and
*vice versa* are necessary to enable *clock recovery*. Intuitively, the
clock recovery problem is that both the encoding and decoding processes
are driven by a clock—every clock cycle the sender transmits a bit and
the receiver recovers a bit. The sender’s and the receiver’s clocks have
to be precisely synchronized in order for the receiver to recover the
same bits the sender transmits. If the receiver’s clock is even slightly
faster or slower than the sender’s clock, then it does not correctly
decode the signal. You could imagine sending the clock to the receiver
over a separate wire, but this is typically avoided because it makes the
cost of cabling twice as high. So, instead, the receiver derives the
clock from the received signal—the clock recovery process. Whenever the
signal changes, such as on a transition from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1, then
the receiver knows it is at a clock cycle boundary, and it can
resynchronize itself. However, a long period of time without such a
transition leads to clock drift. Thus, clock recovery depends on having
lots of transitions in the signal, no matter what data is being sent.

One approach that addresses this problem, called *non-return to zero
inverted* (NRZI), has the sender make a transition from the current
signal to encode a 1 and stay at the current signal to encode
a 0. This solves the problem of consecutive 1s, but obviously does
nothing for consecutive 0s. NRZI is illustrated in :numref:`Figure %s
<fig-encode-all>`. An alternative, called *Manchester encoding*, does
a more explicit job of merging the clock with the signal by
transmitting the exclusive OR of the NRZ-encoded data and the
clock. (Think of the local clock as an internal signal that alternates
from low to high; a low/high pair is considered one clock cycle.) The
Manchester encoding is also illustrated in :numref:`Figure %s
<fig-encode-all>`. Observe that the Manchester encoding results in 0
being encoded as a low-to-high transition and 1 being encoded as a
high-to-low transition. Because both 0s and 1s result in a transition
to the signal, the clock can be effectively recovered at the
receiver.

.. _fig-encode-all:
.. figure:: technology/figures/f02-05.png
   :width: 400px
   :align: center

   Different encoding strategies.

The problem with the Manchester encoding scheme is that it doubles the
rate at which signal transitions are made on the link, which means that
the receiver has half the time to detect each pulse of the signal. The
rate at which the signal changes is called the link’s *baud rate*. In
the case of the Manchester encoding, the bit rate is half the baud rate,
so the encoding is considered only 50% efficient. Keep in mind that if
the receiver had been able to keep up with the faster baud rate required
by the Manchester encoding in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-encode-all>`, then
both NRZ and NRZI could have been able to transmit twice as many bits
in the same time period.

While Manchester encoding creates a situation where the bit rate is
less than the baud rate, this need not be the case. Suppose we used a
modulation scheme with four distinct levels rather than two; this
would allow us to encode two bits into each clock interval, resulting
in a bit rate that is twice the baud rate.  Similarly, if our
modulation scheme allows for eight different signals, we can transmit
three bits per clock interval. In general, modulation is much more
sophisticated than just transmitting "high" and "low" signals.
Instead we talk about transmitting *symbols*, which are distinct
patterns that can be reliably recovered by the receiver.  For example,
it is common to vary a combination of a signal's phase and
amplitude—for a fixed frequency band—making it possible to encode 16,
64, or more different patterns (symbols) during each clock
interval. If we have 64 different symbols, we can encode 6 bits per
symbol. *QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)* is a widely used example
of such a modulation scheme, which we will see again in
Chapter |Shared|.

A more efficient alternative to Manchester encoding, called *4B/5B*,
avoids doubling the baud rate while also ensuring there are no
extended durations of high or low signals. The idea of 4B/5B is to
insert extra bits into the bit stream so as to break up long sequences
of 0s or 1s. Specifically, every 4 bits of actual data are encoded in
a 5-bit code that is then transmitted to the receiver; hence, the name
4B/5B. The 5-bit codes are selected in such a way that each one has no
more than one leading 0 and no more than two trailing 0s. Thus, when
sent back-to-back, no pair of 5-bit codes results in more than three
consecutive 0s being transmitted. The resulting 5-bit codes are then
transmitted using the NRZI encoding, which explains why the code is
only concerned about consecutive 0s—NRZI already solves the problem of
consecutive 1s. Note that the 4B/5B encoding results in 80%
efficiency rather than Manchester's 50%.

:numref:`Table %s <tab-4b5b>` gives the 5-bit codes that correspond to
each of the 16 possible 4-bit data symbols. Notice that since 5 bits
are enough to encode 32 different codes, and we are using only 16 of
these for data, there are 16 codes left over that we can use for other
purposes. Of these, code ``11111`` is used when the line is idle and
code ``01101`` indicates the end of a frame.  Of the remaining
14 codes, 7 of them are not valid because they violate the “one
leading 0, two trailing 0s,” rule. The other six represent various
control symbols.

As for our exemplar link technology, Ethernet has changed its encoding
scheme as its bandwidth improved over time. It originally used
Manchester encoding when it ran at 10-Mbps speeds, but switched to
4B/5B when it was upgraded to run at 100Mbps. The jump to 1Gbps
Ethernet (also called 1GE or 1GigE) was coupled with a change to
8B/10B encoding (8 bits of data encoded in a 10-bit code). And more
recently, 10GE and above uses a 64B/66B encoding.


|Tech|.1.2 Framing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once we're able to transmit a sequence of bits over a physical link,
the next challenge is to subdivide that bit-stream into a sequence of
*frames*, each of which is a self-contained block of data being sent
through a packet-switched network to some destination host. As
described in Section |Intro|.4, the goal of efficiently sharing
network infrastructure is best met through statistical
multiplexing. Packets define the unit of data that allows statistical
multiplexing. A frame is just a name for a packet at the link layer,
and *framing* is the problem of determining exactly what set of bits
constitutes a frame—that is, determining where the frame begins and
ends.

There are several ways to address the framing problem, and each of
them have been used at one time or another by different link
technologies. We briefly introduce two of them here, one of which is
the strategy used by Ethernet.

One of the oldest approaches to framing has its roots in connecting
terminals to mainframes. The idea is to view each frame as a collection
of bytes (characters) rather than a collection of bits. Today, the
widely used Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) still uses this approach.

The idea is to use special *sentinel characters* to indicate where
frames start and end. For example, a frame is everything contained
between a special STX (start of text) and ETX (end of text) character.
The problem with the sentinel approach, of course, is that one of the
special characters might appear in the data portion of the frame. The
standard way to overcome this problem is by “escaping” the character by
preceding it with a DLE (data-link-escape) character whenever it
appears in the body of a frame; the DLE character is also escaped (by
preceding it with an extra DLE) in the frame body. Note that it's also
possible for the special characters to become corrupted, which results
in a *framing error*. When this happens, the receiver has to wait
until the next sentinel character is sent to get back in sync.

Ethernet uses a similar approach, but without assuming anything about
byte-boundaries—it simply views the frame as a collection of bits.
These bits might come from some character set, such as ASCII; they
might be pixel values in an image; or they could be instructions and
operands from an executable file. Specifically, it appends a special
bit pattern to demarcate the beginning of a frame: a 64-bit preamble
consisting of a sequence of alternating 0s and 1s.  Other than that
preamble, the rest of the frame format is exactly as shown in Section
|Intro|.3.3; it includes a 48-bit source address, a 48-bit destination
address, and a 16-bit type field; followed by the payload; followed by
a 32-bit CRC (error detection) code; and finally the end-of-frame code. The sending and
receiving host do not see the preamble, CRC code, or any of the
control codes; they are attached (and stripped) by the network
adaptor.

Note that Ethernet does not need to "escape" the preamble in the
middle of a frame because the encoding scheme (see the previous
subsection) ensures that sequence of bits does not occur in the
message itself.

|Tech|.1.3 Error Detection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bit errors are sometimes introduced into frames during transmission.
This happens, for example, because of electromagnetic interference or
thermal noise. Although errors are rare, especially on optical links,
some mechanism is needed to detect these errors so that corrective
action can be taken.

One of the most common techniques for detecting transmission errors is
known as the *cyclic redundancy check* (CRC). Ethernet uses a 32-bit
CRC code (denoted CRC-32), which works by adding 32 extra bits to
the message. These few bits are enough to provide strong protection
against common bit errors in messages that are thousands of bytes
long. The theoretical foundation of the cyclic redundancy check is
rooted in a branch of mathematics called *finite fields*. While this
may sound daunting, the basic idea is easy to understand.

To start, think of a message containing :math:`n` bits. A simple way
to detect errors would be to attach one extra bit, called a parity bit, on the end of the
message. That bit is set to either zero or one to make the total number of
1s in the message, now :math:`n +1` bits long, even. (That would be
even parity; the other option is odd parity.) With this simple
addition of one bit, we can detect a single bit error. If any bit is
corrupted, the parity bit will have the wrong value, and we know that
an error has occurred. Unfortunately, *two* bit errors, or indeed any
even number of bit errors, would go undetected. CRCs are designed to
be robust against a broad class of bit errors, not just single bit
errors, and they do so with relatively few extra bits in the message.

We will sketch out the mathematics behind CRCs, but in general it's
sufficient to understand that CRCs are just an efficient way to detect
the common errors that occur in transmission. CRCs are invariably
calculated in hardware and very few of us will have to design the
hardware ourselves, so understanding the high-level ideas will
suffice.

To calculate a CRC, an (n+1)-bit message is represented by an :math:`n`
degree polynomial, that is, a polynomial whose highest-order term is
:math:`x^{n}`. The message is represented by a polynomial by using the
value of each bit in the message as the coefficient for each term in
the polynomial, starting with the most significant bit to represent
the highest-order term. For example, an 8-bit message consisting of
the bits 10011010 corresponds to the polynomial

.. math::

   M(x) = (1 \times x^7) + (0 \times x^6) + (0 \times x^5) + (1 \times
   x^4 )+ (1 \times x^3) + (0 \times x^2) + (1 \times x^1) + (0 \times x^0)

.. math::

   M(x) = x^7 + x^4 + x^3 + x^1

Abstractly, then, we can thus think of a sender and a receiver as
exchanging polynomials with each other.

For the purposes of calculating a CRC, a sender and receiver have to
agree on a *divisor* polynomial :math:`C(x)`; a polynomial of degree
:math:`k`. These polynomials are defined in standards such as the
Ethernet standard that defines a degree 32 polynomial.

When a sender wishes to transmit a message :math:`M(x)` that is
n+1 bits long, what is actually sent is the (n+1)-bit message plus
:math:`k` bits. We call the complete transmitted message, including
the redundant bits, :math:`P(x)`. What we are going to do is contrive
to make the polynomial representing :math:`P(x)` exactly divisible by
:math:`C(x)`; we explain how this is achieved below. If :math:`P(x)`
is transmitted over a link and there are no errors introduced during
transmission, then the receiver should be able to divide :math:`P(x)`
by :math:`C(x)` exactly, leaving a remainder of zero. On the other
hand, if some error is introduced into :math:`P(x)` during
transmission, then in all likelihood the received polynomial will no
longer be exactly divisible by :math:`C(x)`, and thus the receiver
will obtain a nonzero remainder implying that an error has occurred.


To create a polynomial for transmission that is
derived from the original message :math:`M(x)`, is :math:`k` bits
longer than :math:`M(x)`, and is exactly divisible by :math:`C(x)`, we
do the following:

1. Multiply :math:`M(x)` by :math:`x^{k}`; that is, add :math:`k`
   zeros at the end of the message. Call this zero-extended message
   :math:`T(x)`.

2. Divide :math:`T(x)` by :math:`C(x)` and find the remainder.

3. Subtract the remainder from :math:`T(x)`.

What is left at this point is a message that
is exactly divisible by :math:`C(x)`. We may also note that the
resulting message consists of :math:`M(x)` followed by the remainder
obtained in step 2, because when we subtracted the remainder (which
can be no more than :math:`k` bits long), we were just XORing it with
the :math:`k` zeros added in step 1.


We now return to the question of where the polynomial :math:`C(x)`
comes from. In short, they are set by standards committees as a result
of tradeoffs (like most standards) with the aim of protecting against
common errors. It is possible to prove that the
following types of errors can be detected by a :math:`C(x)` with the
stated properties:

- All single-bit errors, as long as the :math:`x^{k}` and
  :math:`x^{0}` terms have nonzero coefficients

- All double-bit errors that are :math:`j` bits apart, as long as
  the :math:`x^{0}` term is nonzero and
  :math:`C(x)` does not divide evenly into :math:`x^{j} + 1`

- Any odd number of errors, as long as :math:`C(x)` contains the
  factor :math:`(x + 1)`

- Any “burst” error (i.e., sequence of consecutive errored bits) for
  which the length of the burst is less than :math:`k` bits (Most
  burst errors of length greater than :math:`k` bits can also be
  detected.)

For example, Ethernet uses CRC-32, which meets the above properties
and is defined as follows:

-  CRC-32 = :math:`x^{32} + x^{26} + x^{23} + x^{22} + x^{16} +
   x^{12} + x^{11} + x^{10} + x^8 + x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1`

Ethernet is not the only technology to use this CRC; it is also used
for Wi-Fi and many applications outside of networking such as
the PCI Express computer bus standard.

Finally, we note that the CRC algorithm, while seemingly complex, is
easily implemented in hardware using a :math:`k`\ -bit shift register
and XOR gates. The number of bits in the shift register equals the
degree of the generator polynomial (:math:`k`). :numref:`Figure %s
<fig-crc-hard>` shows the hardware that would be used for the
generator :math:`x^3 + x^2 + 1`. The message
is shifted in from the left, beginning with the most significant bit
and ending with the string of :math:`k` zeros that is attached to the
message, just as in the long division example. When all the bits have
been shifted in and appropriately XORed, the register contains the
remainder—that is, the CRC (most significant bit on the right). The
position of the XOR gates is determined as follows: If the bits in the
shift register are labeled 0 through :math:`k-1`, left to right, then
put an XOR gate in front of bit :math:`n` if there is a term
:math:`x^n` in the generator polynomial.  Thus, we see an XOR gate in
front of positions 0 and 2 for the generator :math:`x^3 + x^2 + x^0`.

|Tech|.1.4 Historical Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ethernet has been the dominant link technology for nearly 50 years,
but a lot has changed since it was first introduced in 1976.
Originally, Ethernet was a *multi-access* technology (connecting tens
or hundreds of nodes to a single shared cable) rather than
*point-to-point* link (connecting only two nodes at either end of a
cable).  This was possible because hosts "tapped" (or were spliced)
into the coaxial Ethernet cable at a nearby point as it snaked up and
down the corridors of office buildings.

Because all the nodes connected to a single cable had to compete to
send messages—i.e., messages sent from two hosts at the same time
would interfere with each other—early Ethernet shared much more with
wireless networks than today's wired networks. In fact, Ethernet's
media access control algorithm was inspired by an earlier wireless
network, called ALOHA, which interconnected computers on the Hawaiian
Islands. And that Ethernet algorithm, in turn, inspired the approach
used by today's Wi-Fi. We describe that algorithm in Chapter |Shared|.

One consequence of multiple nodes having access to a shared medium is
that all the nodes have to be in relatively close proximity to each
other, so they can safely determine when it's safe to transmit. The
original Ethernet access control algorithm required that the RTT—from
one end of an Ethernet to the other and back—be no more than 51.2
μs. This meant that an Ethernet could not be more than 2500 meters
long, clearly limiting it to serve as a *Local-Area Networking (LAN)*
technology. Today, as a predominately point-to-point technology, that
limit is no longer relevant, and Ethernet can now be used for
long-haul links as part of a *Wide-Area Network (WAN)*.

Another big change is that today Ethernet often runs at speeds of 1,
10, or 100 Gbps, rather than the original 10 Mbps standard. As we saw
earlier in this section, this was done in part by upgrading the
encoding algorithm. The rest of the Ethernet standard—the part that's
visible to anyone using Ethernet—remains backward compatible with the
original standard. This adaptability was key to Ethernet's longevity,
but there were two other factors that contributed to its success.

First, an Ethernet is extremely easy to administer and maintain: there
are no configuration tables to be kept up-to-date, and it is easy to
add a new host to the network. You just plug it in. It is hard to
imagine a simpler network to administer.  Second, it is inexpensive to
deploy: cable/fiber is relatively cheap, and the only other cost is
the network adaptor on each host. The adaptor hides any changes in the
encoding scheme, so the software stack sitting on top of the Ethernet
device driver is completely unaware of any changes in modulation or
encoding, as well as whether the link itself is point-to-point or
multi-access.

Ethernet became deeply entrenched for these reasons, and even though
the switch-based approach that eventually replaced the multi-access
cables required additional investment in infrastructure (the
switches), that new infrastructure could be *deployed incrementally*.
That is, some hosts could be connected by point-to-point links to
switched Ethernet, while others remained tapped into coax—all the
while retaining the simplicity of network administration.
