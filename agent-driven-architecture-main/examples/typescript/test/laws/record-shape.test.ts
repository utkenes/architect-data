// ── THE BOOK STATES THE RECORD'S SHAPE, AND IT STATES IT IN TEN PLACES ────
//
// D21 gave `StepRecord` its 14.7 envelope in both ports. The documents spell
// that record's field list at ten sites across three HTML files — pseudocode
// blocks, a normative type declaration, a canonical-names table row, and the
// worked example's own transcript. A section-local edit reconciles the section
// and leaves the DOCUMENT saying one thing two ways, which is exactly how §14.1
// came to mandate `{ schemaVersion, … }` while §14.6's sketch six lines earlier
// showed a record without one.
//
// So the rule is not "these ten lines are correct". It is a DERIVATION over
// the whole wiki tree: find every place a `StepRecord` is written out with a
// field list, and require the envelope to be the first thing in it. A new
// pseudocode block written next year is covered the day it is authored — which
// is the difference between pinning the instances and closing the class.
//
// WHY IT LIVES HERE. test/laws is the ONE citation-exempt path
// (`SKIPPED_PATHS` in citations.test.ts), so this file adds no citation credit
// and cannot move the `examples/typescript` RESOLVABLE_PIN. It is a document
// check, not a code check, which is also why it is not a gate CHECK: the gate's
// seventeen checks read Kotlin and TypeScript trees, not HTML.
