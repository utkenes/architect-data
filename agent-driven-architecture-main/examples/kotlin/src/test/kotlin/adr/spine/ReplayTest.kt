// ── test/spine/replay — G9: a LIVE run against its REPLAY ─────────────────
// The shipped harness asserted f(x) == f(x): it folded one in-memory array twice
// through a pure function. Measured: seam 07's own named violation (a tool reading a
// mutable global and performing a side effect) PASSED it, because foldAll never
// invoked a tool at all.
//
// This asserts something that can actually fail: the state and the FULL effect
// sequence — keys and every timestamp — produced by a live boundary against the same
// two things re-derived from nothing but the committed bytes.

    //
    //   1. THE OLD LOG CANNOT REPLAY AT ALL, in BOTH halves. The ENVELOPE half:
    //      `schemaVersion` has no default, so no construction site can forget it,
    //      and the two versions are different VALUES rather than the same constant
    //      read twice. The PAYLOAD half: a v1 payload is not a ToolResult, so it
    //      cannot enter `StepRecord.results` whatever the envelope says.
    //   2. THE UPCAST IS OBSERVABLE. Re-folding the LIFTED log produces a
    //      different effect sequence from re-folding a native v2 one, in a field
    //      the fold actually consumes. An upcaster whose output nothing reads is a
    //      function that can be deleted with every test still green.
    //
    // WHY THESE ARE REFLECTION AND VALUE ASSERTIONS rather than compile fixtures:
    // this port's must-fail-compile harness is wired to `check`, not `test`, so a
    // compile fixture would not run under the gate that adjudicates this change.
    // Every assertion below is therefore chosen for being able to INVERT — an
    // assertion on a final class's supertype, for instance, is a constant `false`
    // and has no place in a proof set.
    //
    // The v1 log is an in-code typed fixture, not a file: this reference persists
    // nothing (the bus is a list of typed records) and 14.1 leaves the canonical
    // encoding product-owned. So the "old shape" is a TYPE the compiler refuses,
    // which is a stronger fixture than bytes a hand-written parser must agree with.
