// ── test/gate — the gate, and the proof that it DENIES ────────────────────
// Every structural check gets three assertions, on every build:
//
//   LIVE  — it passes on the tree it defends;
//   BLOCK — it REJECTS a deliberately violating fixture;
//   ALLOW — it ACCEPTS the same shape written the way the architecture asks.
//
// The BLOCK half is the red-green proof, executed rather than remembered: delete a
// rule's body and its own test fails immediately, because a check that cannot fail
// is what the review measured (15.2) shipping. The ALLOW half is 15.2's discipline — a rule
// without one drifts into a nuisance authors turn off, and then the gate is
// decorative again.
//
// The three type-aware checks (C3, C9, C14) get the identical treatment one level
// up, in build.gradle.kts: gateDetektBlockTest asserts each one fired on the
// violating fixtures, gateDetektAllowTest asserts none fired on the compliant ones.

     * normalised paths, so the diff is forced here.
     *
     * WHAT IT CANNOT GUARANTEE, stated so nobody reads more into it: it is built from
     * `live`, which is built from `GateTrees.MODULE_ROOTS`, so a file under a root
     * nobody listed is not in `live` and cannot fall out of this list. That case is
     * owned by build.gradle.kts's `gateCompiledRootsAreGateRoots` (a compiled root that
     * is not a gate root) and `gateNoSourceOutsideAdr` (a file beside `adr/` inside a
     * root that is listed). Nor can any of the three see a file that changed MODULE
     * without changing its normalised path — an equality over paths is by construction
     * blind to exactly what normalisation threw away. That is the MODULE OWNERSHIP test
     * below, and it is ONE wall with TWO clauses.
     *
     * FOUR WALLS, FIVE DISJOINT ESCAPES: the two rosters here (a path that moved inside

     * `gateNoSourceOutsideAdr` (a file beside `adr/` in a listed root), and MODULE
     * OWNERSHIP's two clauses — a file that changed MODULE without changing its
     * normalised path, and a block's live rim compiling on the pure side of §5's pair.
     *
     * WHAT THIS ADDS over what was already pinned, so it is an extension and not a second
     * detector at the same layer: the ANCHORS test pins each block's file NAMES grouped by
     * `GateFile.block`, which covers 43 of these 49 but says nothing about the `app/` tier
     * (6 files, previously pinned only as the single `app/Wire.kt` lookup) and nothing
     * about how a path is SPELLED. The equality here is over full normalised paths, and
     * the size assertion closes the partition: 38 + 49 = 87, so every file the gate reads
     * is named by one of the two rosters and a disappearance cannot be silent.

     * can change MODULE without changing its path, and the module is where §5's
     * pure/adapter split has teeth — the IO-library ban is a CLASSPATH ban keyed on the
     * Gradle module (`adr.spine` and `adr.block` are its only two owners, ADR-001:366,
     * and settings.gradle.kts:56-70 is what binds a module DIRECTORY to the role plugin
     * carrying that ban), while every rule in Rules.kt and every pin above is keyed on
     * the normalised path. Two measured escapes, both BUILD SUCCESSFUL before this test:
     *
     *   ADAPTER INTO PURE. Move a block's live adapter out of `:block:<x>:adapter` into
     *       `:block:<x>`, delete the emptied `src` tree, drop the two root-list entries.
     *       The result is shape-identical to the three legitimately source-free adapter
     *       modules, so `gateSourceRootsPresent`, `gateCompiledRootsAreGateRoots` and
     *       `gateNoSourceOutsideAdr` are all correctly silent — and the block's live IO
     *       now compiles inside the module `adr.block` declares pure. RENAMING the file
     *       on the way (`Adapter.kt` -> `Rim.kt`) buys the entire exploit back from any
     *       rule keyed on the file NAME, which is why RIM OCCUPANCY below is keyed on
     *       SUPERTYPES instead, and why [GateTrees.owedRoots] deliberately permits
     *       either member of the pair for a block file.
     *   PURE INTO APP. Move `spine/surface/Controller.kt` from `:spine` into `:app`. It
     *       is referenced only by `app/Wire.kt`, so it compiles; both root lists stay
     *       untouched because both roots still hold Kotlin; the file is still
     *       `spine/surface/Controller.kt` to every rule and roster. `:app` is the
     *       composition root and `adr.root.gradle.kts` applies no
     *       `denyExternalLibrariesExcept`, so an arbitrary third-party IO library
     *       follows the file across: MEASURED, the coordinate `org.postgresql:postgresql`
     *       FAILS CONFIGURATION on `:spine` ("`:spine` is PURE — ADR-001 §3 forbids an
     *       IO/external library on its classpath") and is BUILD SUCCESSFUL on `:app`
     *       with the relocated file importing `org.postgresql.Driver`.
     *
     * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLOSE, measured rather than assumed, because a wall whose KDoc
     * overclaims is worse than no KDoc. `denyExternalLibrariesExcept`
     * (build-logic/src/main/kotlin/AdrDag.kt:216-229) filters `ExternalModuleDependency`
     * and checks `"${dep.group}:${dep.name}"` — Gradle COORDINATES. A JDK package has no
     * coordinate, so it was never gated in any module: `import java.sql.DriverManager`
     * inside the UNMOVED `spine/surface/Controller.kt` is BUILD SUCCESSFUL today. That
     * gap belongs to C8's impure-import prefix list (Rules.kt:288-292, which names
     * `java.io|java.net|java.nio|kotlinx.coroutines|ai.torad` and not `java.sql`), and
     * widening it is a separate invariant owing its own fixture pair. This test closes
     * the RELOCATION, not that gap.
     *
     * WHY HERE AND NOT AS AN EIGHTEENTH KONSIST CHECK: this is a roster-class pin, the
     * same kind as MODULE ROOTS and the two path rosters above, and it lives beside
     * them. A C18 would have to enter THE ROSTER map and its size assertion, and would
     * owe an on-disk fixture pair the shape cannot produce without standing up a SECOND
     * live module tree — a [GateFile] wraps a Konsist declaration and cannot be forged.
     * The pair is therefore in-checker, and its inputs are DERIVED FROM `live` rather
     * than frozen as path literals: a frozen pair survives the very relocation it exists
     * to deny, goes on asserting about a path that no longer exists in any module root,
     * and stays green. That is C7's rot one seam over, and it is what the predecessor of
     * this test shipped.

     *    `internal constructor` on `TriageResult.SetPriority` fails

     *    out: MEASURED, `internal` in `:spine` is invisible to this root test project,

     * folder, zero production sites outside it. A site that escaped — a root branch, a

     * per verb — a fourth site for the append it is pricing — and the census would then
     * be reporting its own maintenance. So the cases come off Konsist's parse tree
     * (direct parents of the block's own two sealed unions) and the anti-vacuity guards
     * are shape guards instead of a list: every block declares at least one case, the
     * `Result` and `Command` halves carry the SAME names (a verb is a PAIR — sites 1
     * and 2), and no two blocks share a case name, which is what makes a NAME census
     * exact rather than approximate.
     *
     * SITE 3 IS COUNTED THROUGH THE RESOLVER, NOT THROUGH THE TEXT. The number of
     * classified `Verb` rows in the block's table must equal the number of cases — and
     * "classified `Verb` row" is resolved by [GateFacts.spellingsOf] from the file's own
     * imports and typealiases, never matched as the literal string `Verb.Reversible`.
     * The difference is a false positive on a compliant tree: `import
     * adr.spine.pure.Verb.Reversible` and then `Reversible(` is the same table written
     * one keystroke differently, and a spelling-keyed clause rejects it. This one does
     * not, and the compliant fixture is authored in exactly that idiom so the ACCEPT is
     * measured rather than argued.
     *
     * UNIFORMITY IS THE SAME CLAUSE, not a second one. §6.8's deleted carve-out ("a UI

     * ROW 1 OF THE BLAST-RADIUS TABLE, MEASURED — the row `docs/DECISIONS.md:122`
     * schedules: a verb whose effects reuse effect kinds that already exist.
     *
     * THIS TEST USED TO LIE, and the lie is worth recording because it is the exact
     * shape §15.2 warns about. Its name said "FOUR appends, three files, one folder";
     * its body asserted that each block owns the six block files and that console's
     * `Tools.kt` contains the substrings `Verb.Reversible(` and `sign =`. It counted no
     * appends and checked no containment — a vacuous instrument wearing the name of the
     * result it did not measure, in the one file whose job is to deny exactly that.
     *
     * WHAT IT MEASURES NOW: [rowOneViolations], on the live tree, on a violating
     * fixture and on a compliant one — plus the MODULE clause, which is live-only
     * because a fixture tree has no Gradle modules to be read from.
     *
     * THE MODULE CLAUSE is why `docs/DECISIONS.md:122` schedules this row at all. The
     * three files are ONE FOLDER and TWO MODULES: `Contract.kt` is read from `:spine`,
     * because Kotlin seals a hierarchy within one module and a block's transport
     * therefore has to be authored in the shared core, while `Tools.kt` and `Fold.kt`
     * are read from the block's own `:block:<x>`. The retired slogan was never wrong
     * about the FOLDER — this census measures it and it holds — it was wrong about the
     * compilation unit, and the honest replacement is the split, asserted. `GateFile.root`
     * is what makes it assertable: normalisation deliberately throws the module away,
     * and this is one of the two places that keeps it.
