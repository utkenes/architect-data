  [UDS] Generate usage documentation (cheatsheets, references, guides) from project sources.
  Use when: producing a cheatsheet or feature reference from CLI and skill definitions, regenerating docs after commands change, checking generated docs are current.
  Not for: deciding what documentation a project needs or writing prose by hand — use /documentation-guide; changelog entries — use /changelog.
  Keywords: docgen, usage docs, cheatsheet, feature reference, generated documentation, 使用文件, 速查表, 文件產生.

# 2026-08-18: `disable-model-invocation: true` removed, and a status recorded.
#
# The flag was applied by d415937e alongside the description rewrite and, like
# the two lifted on 2026-08-17, followed no stateable rule. These eight were
# left alone that day for a reason that was correct at the time: the rule
# settled on was "a reference is model-invocable", and none of them carried a
# `status` at all, so lifting them would have replaced one unruled state with
# one unruled action.
#
# Measured 2026-08-18, which is what closed it: all eight carry a full
# `Use when:` trigger and a `Not for:` exclusion, all eight describe an action
# rather than reference material, and all eight already have a slash command —
# which is exactly the shape of `code-review-assistant`, whose paired `/code-review`
# was ruled not to justify the flag. `journey-test-assistant` is the standing
# precedent: same "Generate X" shape, `status: stable`, never disabled.
#
# `stable` rather than a new value: `skills/` uses reference, stable and
# experimental, and inventing a fourth would be the same unruled-action mistake
# in different clothing.
#
# The cost of being wrong is asymmetric and observable in only one direction.
# Over-triggering shows up and is undone by deleting a line; a skill that is
# structurally unable to fire produces no signal at all. (XSPEC-378 R5)

# Documentation Generator | 文件產生器

Generate usage documentation (cheatsheets, references, guides) from project source files.

從專案原始檔案產生使用文件（速查表、參考手冊、使用指南）。

## Workflow | 工作流程

1. **Read config** - Load `.usage-docs.yaml` (or specified config file)
2. **Scan sources** - Read source files, commands, and skill definitions
3. **Extract content** - Parse descriptions, options, examples from source
4. **Generate docs** - Produce output in the configured format
5. **Write output** - Save generated files to the configured output directory

## Config File Format | 設定檔格式

```yaml
# .usage-docs.yaml
output_dir: docs/generated/
formats:
  - cheatsheet
  - reference
sources:
  - path: skills/commands/
    type: commands
  - path: cli/src/commands/
    type: cli
language: [en, zh-TW]
```

## Output Types | 輸出類型

| Type | Description | 說明 |
|------|-------------|------|
| **cheatsheet** | Quick reference card with commands and shortcuts | 速查表，列出命令與快捷方式 |
| **reference** | Comprehensive feature reference with all options | 完整功能參考手冊含所有選項 |
| **usage-guide** | Step-by-step usage guide for new users | 新手入門的逐步使用指南 |

## Usage | 使用方式

- `/docgen` - Generate docs using default `.usage-docs.yaml`
- `/docgen .usage-docs.yaml` - Generate docs from specified config file
- `/docgen --format cheatsheet` - Generate cheatsheet only

## Check Mode | 檢查模式

Verify that generated documentation is up to date with source files.

驗證產生的文件是否與原始檔案保持同步。

**Usage | 使用方式:**

```bash
# Check if generated docs are in sync
./scripts/check-usage-docs-sync.sh

# Auto-fix out-of-sync docs
./scripts/check-usage-docs-sync.sh --fix
```

- **Check mode** (default): Reports differences between source and generated docs. Exits with non-zero status if out of sync.
- **Fix mode** (`--fix`): Automatically regenerates out-of-date documentation files.

> **Note | 注意**: This check is integrated into `pre-release-check.sh` as Step 8 (Usage docs sync check).
>
> 此檢查已整合至 `pre-release-check.sh` 的步驟 8（使用文件同步檢查）。

## Generated Output Example | 產生範例

```markdown
# UDS Command Cheatsheet

| Command    | Description               |
|------------|---------------------------|
| /commit    | Generate commit message    |
| /code-review    | Run code review            |
| /sdd       | Create SDD specification   |
| /discover  | Assess project health      |
```

## Next Steps Guidance | 下一步引導

After `/docgen` completes, the AI assistant should suggest:

> **文件已產生。建議下一步 / Documentation generated. Suggested next steps:**
> - 審查產生的文件內容是否完整 — Review generated content for completeness
> - 執行 `/commit` 提交文件變更 ⭐ **Recommended / 推薦** — Commit documentation changes
> - 執行 `/code-review` 審查文件品質 — Review documentation quality
