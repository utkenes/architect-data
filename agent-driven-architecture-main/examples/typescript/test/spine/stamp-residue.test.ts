// ── G1 — THE RUNTIME HALF OF THE STAMP WALL, AND ITS NAMED RESIDUE ─────────
//
// test/gate/forge.test.ts proves the stamp cannot be SPELLED, and C4 proves the
// constructor cannot be BOUND outside `spine/boundary`. Neither closes the
// forge, and this file exists because that was measured rather than argued:
// against the shape-plus-lint version of this wall, EIGHT assertion-free
// vectors compiled AND linted clean inside a real block fold arm with the whole
// gate at EXIT=0 —
//
//     Object.assign({}, sig, { by: "Human" })              // T & U
//     Object.assign(structuredClone(sig), { by: "Human" }) // T -> T
//     patch(sig, { by: "Human" })                          // <T>(T, Partial<T>) => T
//     withField(sig, "by", "Human")                        // <T, K extends keyof T>
//     const widen: { by: string } = sig; widen.by = "Human"   // structural write
//     Reflect.set(sig, "by", "Human")                      // reflective write
//     Object.assign(sig, { by: "Human" })                   // IN-PLACE, on the boundary's own stamp
//     new (sig.constructor as new (…) => Signature)("Human", sig.authority)
//
// — and the seventh put `by: "Human"` on the COMMITTED, append-only StepRecord
// the boundary had just stamped `Agent`. The launder lives in the GENERIC
// SIGNATURE, not in the brand, so no spelling of the brand (`unique symbol`,
// `private`, `#`) can reach it, and the eighth produces a real branded frozen
// instance that no shape check could ever distinguish.
//
// Two runtime walls close the class, and this file is their enforcement layer —
// G6's bar met with a vitest probe rather than a fixture pair, because the
// invariant is about values at run time and not about syntax:
//
//   FREEZE    the minted stamp cannot be relabelled IN PLACE, so the record the
//             boundary committed keeps the actor the gate saw.
//   IDENTITY  a Command may only carry the stamp its own step minted, checked
//             at the single `verb.sign` call site — the one check a type
//             launder, a cast, an `any` and constructor reflection all fail.
//
// The third test is not a wall. It PINS A RESIDUE: `Reflect.set` on a frozen
// object returns `false` instead of throwing. The value is protected, the
// caller is not told, and writing that down is the difference between a bounded
// claim and a slogan.
