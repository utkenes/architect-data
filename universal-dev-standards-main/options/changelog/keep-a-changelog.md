## Overview

Keep a Changelog is a standard format for maintaining human-readable changelogs. It emphasizes clarity and consistency, making it easy for users and developers to understand what has changed between versions.

## Best For

- Open source projects
- Projects requiring human-readable changelogs
- Projects following Semantic Versioning
- Manual release management
- Projects where curated release notes matter

## Format Structure

```markdown
# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added

### Deprecated

## Change Types

| Type | Order | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Added** | 1 | New features |
| **Changed** | 2 | Changes in existing functionality |
| **Deprecated** | 3 | Soon-to-be removed features |
| **Removed** | 4 | Removed features |
| **Fixed** | 5 | Bug fixes |
| **Security** | 6 | Security vulnerability fixes |

## Core Principles

1. **Changelogs are for humans** - Not machine-generated commit dumps
2. **Every version gets a section** - Even if no changes
3. **Group by type** - Use the standard change types
4. **Dates are ISO format** - Use YYYY-MM-DD
5. **Latest first** - Reverse chronological order
6. **Unreleased section** - Track ongoing changes
