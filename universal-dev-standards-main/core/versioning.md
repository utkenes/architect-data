# Semantic Versioning Standard

> **Language**: English | [繁體中文](../locales/zh-TW/core/versioning.md)

**Version**: 1.5.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-07-01
**Applicability**: All software projects with versioned releases
**Scope**: universal
**Industry Standards**: Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
**References**: [semver.org](https://semver.org/)

---

## Purpose

This standard defines how to version software releases using Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to communicate changes clearly to users and maintainers.

---

## Semantic Versioning Format

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE][+BUILD]

Examples:
2.3.1
1.0.0-alpha.1
3.2.0-beta.2+20250112
```

### Components

| Component | Purpose | When to Increment |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **MAJOR** | Breaking changes | Incompatible API changes |
| **MINOR** | New features | Backward-compatible functionality |
| **PATCH** | Bug fixes | Backward-compatible bug fixes |
| **PRERELEASE** | Pre-release identifier | Alpha, beta, rc versions |
| **BUILD** | Build metadata | Build number, commit hash |

---

## Incrementing Rules

### MAJOR Version (X.0.0)

**Increment when**:
- Breaking API changes
- Removing deprecated features
- Major architecture changes
- Incompatible behavior changes

**Examples**:
```
1.9.5 → 2.0.0  # Remove deprecated API
3.2.1 → 4.0.0  # Change return type of public method
```

**Guidelines**:
- Reset MINOR and PATCH to 0
- Document migration guide
- Provide deprecation warnings in previous MINOR versions

---

### MINOR Version (x.Y.0)

**Increment when**:
- Adding new features (backward-compatible)
- Deprecating features (not removing)
- Substantial internal improvements
- New public APIs

**Examples**:
```
2.3.5 → 2.4.0  # Add new API endpoint
1.12.0 → 1.13.0  # Add optional parameter to existing function
```

**Guidelines**:
- Reset PATCH to 0
- Existing functionality unchanged
- New features are opt-in

---

### PATCH Version (x.y.Z)

**Increment when**:
- Bug fixes (no new features)
- Security patches
- Documentation corrections
- Internal refactoring (no API changes)

**Examples**:
```
3.1.2 → 3.1.3  # Fix null pointer exception
2.0.0 → 2.0.1  # Security vulnerability patch
```

**Guidelines**:
- No new functionality
- No API changes
- Safe to update immediately

---

## Pre-release Versions

Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-PRERELEASE`

### Pre-release Identifiers

| Identifier | Purpose | Stability | Audience |
|------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| `alpha` | Early testing | Unstable | Internal team |
| `beta` | Feature complete | Mostly stable | Early adopters |
| `rc` (release candidate) | Final testing | Stable | Beta testers |

### Examples

```
1.0.0-alpha.1       # First alpha release
1.0.0-alpha.2       # Second alpha release
1.0.0-beta.1        # First beta release
1.0.0-beta.2        # Second beta release
1.0.0-rc.1          # Release candidate 1
1.0.0               # Stable release
```

### Ordering

Pre-releases are ordered lexicographically:
```
1.0.0-alpha.1 < 1.0.0-alpha.2 < 1.0.0-beta.1 < 1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0
```

---

## Build Metadata

Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+BUILD`

### Examples

```
1.0.0+20250112            # Date-based build
2.3.1+001                 # Sequential build number
3.0.0+sha.5114f85         # Git commit hash
1.2.0-beta.1+exp.sha.5114f85  # Combined pre-release and build
```

### Guidelines

- Build metadata SHOULD NOT affect version precedence
- Use for CI/CD tracking
- Include in artifacts but not in version comparison

> **Critical: build metadata MUST NOT be used as a deployment discriminator.**
> Because tooling ignores `+build` in precedence and comparison (above), two builds
> differing only in build metadata (`1.2.3+abc` vs `1.2.3+def`) are **indistinguishable
> to version-comparison tooling** — rollback targets and `semver` comparison treat them
> as the same release. Using `+sha` to tell apart behaviorally-different deployed builds
> is a governance bypass: the version stops being the join key for changelog / SBOM /
> audit / rollback / SLA / CVE scope. A change that ships MUST get a real version bump or
> a unique immutable artifact identity (see **Deployment Version Identity** below) —
> `+sha` is **not** a substitute.

---

## Deployment Version Identity

> Source: a recurring failure mode — multiple behaviorally-different hotfix builds
> deployed under the same `X.Y.Z`, distinguishable only by `+sha`, so answering
> "which build is in prod / is fix X actually deployed?" collapses into commit
> archaeology.

This section governs the identity of a **deployable unit** — whatever that unit is for the
project (a container image, a tarball, a published package). It complements the
[Release Process](#release-process) below, which describes one concrete single-host release
flow; the identity rules here apply regardless of the deployment mechanism.

### Core invariant

**Every distinct deployable build artifact MUST carry a unique, immutable version
identity (version proper + commit sha).** Deploying, *promoting*, or *rolling back*
an **existing** artifact MUST NOT change its identity.

- **Anchor on the artifact, not the deploy action.** A new build (different source or
  dependencies) ⇒ new version. The *same* build moved between environments
  (staging → prod, build-once-deploy-many), redeployed (blue-green / canary), or
  rolled back is the **same** artifact and keeps its identity — it MUST NOT be
  re-bumped. Re-bumping on promote/rollback makes the version number lie about what
  is actually running. (When a rollback restores a previous artifact, it restores that
  artifact's original identity — it does not mint a new one.)
- **Never deploy two distinct builds under the same `X.Y.Z`.**

### Enforce automatically, not by discipline

The invariant SHOULD be enforced by an automatic mechanism rather than human discipline
alone — the failure mode above *is* a forgotten manual bump. Any of these satisfies it:

- **Commit-driven release automation** (`semantic-release` / `standard-version`, see
  [Automation Tools](#automation-tools)): derives and bumps the version from commit
  history in CI, so a human cannot forget to bump.
- **Git-height–derived versioning** (MinVer / Nerdbank.GitVersioning / GitVersion):
  the version is derived from git commit topology, so a collision is structurally
  impossible. RECOMMENDED for polyglot / .NET / JVM projects (the Automation Tools
  section is otherwise Node-centric) — see the git-height subsection under
  [Automation Tools](#automation-tools). Note caveats for monorepos and squash-merge
  workflows.
- **A CI uniqueness gate**: fail the release if the computed version already exists
  as a git tag or in the registry.

### Immutable artifacts (cross-reference)

A unique *number* is necessary but not sufficient — the *artifact* must also be immutable
and content-addressed (e.g. a container image referenced by digest rather than a mutable
tag). The concrete artifact-level requirements — pinning deployments to a content address
and forbidding tag/version reuse — **belong with container-image-standards** and are to be
specified there; this standard only requires that the version identity itself remain
unique and immutable.

### Build identity is observable (requirement)

**A deployed service MUST expose its build identity — `version + commit sha + build time` —
through a queryable endpoint** (a dedicated `/version`, or embedded in `/health`), so
operators can determine exactly what is running without inspecting the binary or resorting to
commit archaeology. Rationale: manual version numbers can collide (above), so ops needs the
`sha` to tell apart two builds that ship under the same `X.Y.Z`.

Requirements:

- The exposed `sha` MUST match the deployed artifact's sha — it is **verifiable, not
  self-reported** (derive it from the build, do not hand-type it).
- The endpoint SHOULD be access-controlled; a public build-identity endpoint leaks internal
  commit identity.
- Post-release verification MUST assert the returned sha equals the deployed artifact's sha
  (see [Phase 5: Post-release Verification](#phase-5-post-release-verification)), not merely
  that the version number is correct.

This is a deployment / observability concern: the concrete verification *mechanism* (how the
endpoint is scraped and the assertion wired into a gate) **belongs with deployment-standards**
(to be specified there), and **supply-chain-attestation** already provides provenance as
the cryptographic backing for "this artifact came from this sha".

## Changelog Integration

> **See Also**: For comprehensive CHANGELOG writing guidelines, format templates, and examples, see [changelog-standards.md](changelog-standards.md).

### CHANGELOG.md Quick Reference

CHANGELOG files should follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format with these categories:

| Category | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| `Added` | New features |
| `Changed` | Changes to existing functionality |
| `Deprecated` | Features to be removed in future |
| `Removed` | Removed features |
| `Fixed` | Bug fixes |
| `Security` | Security vulnerability patches |

**Breaking Changes**: Prefix with `**BREAKING**:` to ensure visibility.

For complete format templates and examples, refer to [changelog-standards.md](changelog-standards.md).

### Exclusion Rules

CHANGELOG should NOT record the following types of changes:

#### 1. Directories Excluded by `.gitignore`

Directories excluded from version control will not be committed, so they should not be recorded in CHANGELOG.

**Principle**: Any directories or files listed in the project's `.gitignore` should not be recorded in CHANGELOG.

**Common Exclusion Categories (Examples)**:

| Category | Common Directories/Files | Reason |
|----------|-------------------------|--------|
| AI Collaboration Tools | `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.ai/` | Local development aids, not in version control |
| Development Standards | `.standards/` | Local standard docs, not in version control |
| Build Outputs | `dist/`, `build/`, `out/` | Build artifacts, not in version control |
| Large Data | `data/`, `datasets/` | Data files, not in version control |

**Verification Method**:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
# Before generating CHANGELOG, check project's .gitignore exclusions
cat .gitignore | grep -E "^[^#*]" | head -20
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Before generating CHANGELOG, check project's .gitignore exclusions
Get-Content .gitignore | Where-Object { $_ -match "^[^#*]" } | Select-Object -First 20
```

**Note**: Each project should determine exclusions based on its own `.gitignore` settings. The table above is just a common example.

#### 2. Build Artifacts and Temporary Files

The following types of changes should also not be recorded:

- `bin/`, `obj/`, `Release/`, `Debug/` and other build outputs
- `*.log`, `*.tmp` and other temporary files
- `node_modules/`, `packages/` and other dependency directories

#### 3. Environment and Configuration Files (Sensitive Data)

Files containing sensitive data should not be recorded:

- `*.env`, `.env.*` environment variable files
- `*.local.json`, `*.local.yaml` local configuration files (e.g., .NET's `appsettings.*.local.json`)
- `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12` key and certificate files
- `credentials.*`, `secrets.*` credential files

### Best Practice

When generating CHANGELOG, follow this process:

1. **List changed commits**

   **macOS / Linux / Windows (Git):**
   ```bash
   git log main..HEAD --oneline
   ```

2. **Exclude commits that don't need recording**
   - Commits containing "gitignore", "version control", or "misc(version control)" types
   - Commits that only modify excluded directories

3. **Categorize records**
   - Only record actual code or documentation changes that will be committed to the repository
   - Ensure all recorded file paths exist in the repository

4. **Verify records**

   **macOS / Linux:**
   ```bash
   # Verify that recorded paths exist in the repository
   git ls-files | grep -E "path/to/file"
   ```

   **Windows PowerShell:**
   ```powershell
   # Verify that recorded paths exist in the repository
   git ls-files | Select-String -Pattern "path/to/file"
   ```

## Release Process

### Overview

The complete Release process includes 5 phases:

1. **Pre-release Diagnosis** - Mandatory
2. **Environment Preparation**
3. **Package Generation**
4. **Deployment Execution**
5. **Post-release Verification**

### Phase 1: Pre-release Diagnosis - Mandatory

**Purpose**: Assess the target server's environment status before generating the upgrade package

**Check Items**:
- System tool versions
- Required drivers
- Disk space
- Database connectivity
- Application version
- Configuration completeness

**Pass Conditions** (Quality Gate):
- All required tools installed
- Sufficient disk space (at least 500MB)
- Database connection normal
- No system-level errors

**Failure Handling**:
- If diagnosis fails, execute Environment Preparation (Phase 2)
- Re-execute diagnosis after fixes
- Must not skip diagnosis and proceed directly to packaging

---

### Phase 2: Environment Preparation

**Purpose**: Install missing tools and drivers according to diagnosis report results

**Verification Standards**:
- All diagnosis items passed
- Database connection test successful
- Verification tools show no errors

---

### Phase 3: Package Generation

**Purpose**: Generate upgrade package containing the latest version

**Execution Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Confirm current branch and version
git branch
git describe --tags

# 2. Generate upgrade package (using project-provided packaging script)
./tools/generate-upgrade-package.sh -v v1.2.1 -o ./dist

# 3. Verify upgrade package contents
tar -tzf dist/upgrade-package-*.tar.gz | head -20
```

#### Upgrade Package Naming

**Format**: `{PROJECT}-upgrade-v{VERSION}-{DATE}.tar.gz`

| Element | Description | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `{PROJECT}` | Project name (replace with actual project name) | `my-app`, `api-server` |
| `{VERSION}` | Version number (consistent with Git tag) | `1.2.1`, `2.0.0-beta.1` |
| `{DATE}` | Packaging date (YYYYMMDD) | `20251128` |

**Examples** (replace `{PROJECT}` with your project name):
```
{PROJECT}-upgrade-v1.2.1-20251127.tar.gz
{PROJECT}-upgrade-v2.0.0-beta.1-20251201.tar.gz
```

---

### Phase 4: Deployment Execution

**Purpose**: Execute upgrade on target server

**Execution Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Upload upgrade package to target server
scp upgrade-package-*.tar.gz user@target:/tmp/

# 2. Extract upgrade package
cd /tmp
tar -xzf upgrade-package-*.tar.gz
cd upgrade-package-*/

# 3. Dry-run test (strongly recommended)
sudo ./upgrade.sh --dry-run

# 4. Actual upgrade
sudo ./upgrade.sh
```

**Deployment Verification**:
- Backup created
- Service stopped successfully
- Files deployed successfully
- Schema migration successful (if applicable)
- Service started successfully

---

### Phase 5: Post-release Verification

**Purpose**: Confirm upgrade success and application running normally

**Check Items**:
```bash
# 1. Check service status
systemctl status your-service

# 2. Check application build identity (version + commit sha + build time)
#    Assert the returned sha matches the deployed artifact's sha — not just the version.
curl http://localhost:PORT/version    # or /health, if build identity is embedded there
# Expected: {"version": "1.2.1", "sha": "<deployed-artifact-sha>", "buildTime": "..."}

# 3. Check logs for no errors
tail -100 /path/to/app.log | grep -i error
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Service running normally
- `/version` (or `/health`) returns the correct version number **and** a commit sha that
  matches the deployed artifact — a matching version alone is insufficient, since two builds
  can share one `X.Y.Z` (see [Build identity is observable](#build-identity-is-observable-requirement))
- No fatal errors in logs
- Functionality verification passed

---

sudo systemctl stop your-service

# 2. Restore backup
BACKUP_PATH="/path/to/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
sudo rm -rf /path/to/app
sudo mv "$BACKUP_PATH" /path/to/app

# 3. Restart service
sudo systemctl start your-service

# 4. Verify rollback success
sudo systemctl status your-service
```

---

### Compliance

**Mandatory Requirements**:
- Must not skip diagnosis phase
- Must not skip dry-run test
- Must retain diagnosis report
- Must prepare rollback plan

**Audit Trail**:
- All Release documentation retained for at least 12 months
- Diagnosis report associated with Git Tag
- Upgrade logs preserved completely

---

## Version Tagging in Git

### Creating Tags

```bash
# Annotated tag (recommended)
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"

# Tag with detailed message
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Release version 2.0.0

Major changes:
- New authentication system
- Redesigned API
- Performance improvements"

# Push tag to remote
git push origin v1.2.0

# Push all tags
git push origin --tags
```

### Tag Naming Convention

```
v1.0.0          ✅ Recommended (with 'v' prefix)
1.0.0           ✅ Acceptable (without 'v')
version-1.0.0   ❌ Avoid (too verbose)
1.0             ❌ Avoid (incomplete version)
```

---

## Automation Tools

### standard-version (Node.js)

```bash
# Install
npm install --save-dev standard-version

# Add to package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "release": "standard-version"
  }
}

# Create release
npm run release              # Auto-increment based on commits
npm run release -- --release-as minor  # Force minor version
npm run release -- --release-as 2.0.0  # Specific version
```

### semantic-release (Node.js)

```bash
# Install
npm install --save-dev semantic-release

# Configure in .releaserc.json
{
  "branches": ["main"],
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@semantic-release/changelog",
    "@semantic-release/npm",
    "@semantic-release/git",
    "@semantic-release/github"
  ]
}
```

### Git-height–derived versioning (polyglot: .NET / JVM / multi-language)

The tools above are Node/npm-centric. For **.NET, JVM, or multi-language projects**, prefer
**git-height–derived versioning**, where the version is computed automatically from the git
tag graph plus the number of commits since the last tag ("commit height") rather than stored
in a hand-edited file. Because the version is a deterministic function of git history,
**two different builds cannot collide on the same version number** and no manual bump step
can be forgotten — this is what makes it satisfy
[Deployment Version Identity](#deployment-version-identity) structurally rather than by
discipline.

| Tool | Ecosystem | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **MinVer** | .NET / MSBuild | Derives the version from the nearest git tag plus commit height; no config file, no build server integration required |
| **Nerdbank.GitVersioning** (nbgv) | .NET (also Node and others) | Reads a `version.json`; stamps version + git height + commit id into assemblies and packages |
| **GitVersion** | Polyglot (.NET, plus a language-agnostic CLI) | Configurable versioning modes (e.g. Mainline, Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment) driven by branch and tag topology |

**When to use which:**

- **Node / npm projects** → commit-driven automation (`semantic-release` / `standard-version`, above): the bump is derived from Conventional Commits.
- **Polyglot / .NET / JVM projects** → git-height–derived tools (MinVer / Nerdbank.GitVersioning / GitVersion): the version is derived from git tag + commit height.

Both families remove the forgettable manual bump. **Caveats:** in a monorepo a single
repo-wide commit height may not map cleanly onto per-package versions, and squash-merge
workflows alter commit height — validate the derived version against your tagging convention.

---

## Dependency Version Ranges

### npm (package.json)

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "exact": "1.2.3",           // Exact version
    "patch": "~1.2.3",          // >=1.2.3 <1.3.0
    "minor": "^1.2.3",          // >=1.2.3 <2.0.0
    "range": ">=1.2.3 <2.0.0",  // Explicit range
    "latest": "*"               // ❌ Avoid - any version
  }
}
```

**Recommendations**:
- Use `^` for most dependencies (minor updates)
- Use `~` for conservative updates (patch only)
- Use exact versions for critical dependencies
- Never use `*` in production

---

### .NET (csproj)

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <!-- Exact version -->
  <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.1" />

  <!-- Minimum version -->
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging" Version="[8.0.0,)" />

  <!-- Version range -->
  <PackageReference Include="AutoMapper" Version="[12.0.0,13.0.0)" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Breaking Changes & Deprecation

Breaking changes drive the **MAJOR** version increment (see [Incrementing Rules](#incrementing-rules)) — that is how SemVer signals an incompatible change to consumers. The *contract-level* details of evolving and retiring an API are owned by the standards responsible for those concerns, so each rule has a single source of truth:

- **API versioning strategies, the backward-compatibility checklist (what counts as a breaking change), deprecation annotations in code, and the migration-guide template** → [API Design Standards](api-design-standards.md#api-versioning-strategies)
- **The deprecation lifecycle, minimum notice periods by API tier, `Sunset` / `Deprecation` headers, and consumer notification** → [Deprecation & Sunset Standards](deprecation-standards.md#api-deprecation)

This standard keeps only the version-numbering rule: an incompatible change MUST ship as a MAJOR bump, and deprecation SHOULD be announced in a prior MINOR before the removing MAJOR (see [MAJOR Version](#major-version-x00) guidelines).

---

## Version Comparison

### Precedence Rules

```
1.0.0 < 2.0.0 < 2.1.0 < 2.1.1

1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0-alpha.1 < 1.0.0-beta < 1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0

1.0.0 < 1.0.0+001 (build metadata ignored in precedence)
```

### Comparison in Code

```javascript
// JavaScript (using semver package)
const semver = require('semver');

semver.gt('1.2.3', '1.2.2');  // true
semver.satisfies('1.2.3', '^1.0.0');  // true
semver.major('2.3.1');  // 2
```

---

## Common Questions

### Q: When should I release 1.0.0?

**A**: When your API is stable and you're ready to commit to backward compatibility.

---

### Q: Should I bump MAJOR for internal breaking changes?

**A**: No, only for public API changes. Internal refactoring is PATCH or MINOR.

---

### Q: Can I skip versions?

**A**: Yes, but not recommended. Use sequential versioning for clarity.

---

### Q: How do I version libraries vs applications?

**A**:
- **Libraries**: Strictly follow SemVer (API matters)
- **Applications**: Can be more flexible (user experience matters)
