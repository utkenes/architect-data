// ── SDK-1 / VERB-SURFACE — the leverage point, and what it actually was ──────
// `VerbSpec` had slots for six things: name, describe, schema, run, sign, kind.
// The adapter that turns verbs into the runtime's tools is a generic loop that
// knows nothing about any specific tool, so it could only ever emit what the
// Verb type could HOLD. A block therefore could not declare model-facing
// behaviour the runtime supports — not because the spine forbade it, but because
// there was nowhere to put it.
//
// That is why this was the campaign's leverage point rather than one item among
// many: `toModelOutput`, `inputExamples`, `strict` and per-tool policy were all
// unreachable BY CONSTRUCTION, and every one of them reads in review as "they
// did not use the SDK properly" when the truth is "the IR could not express it".
//
// THE TEST THAT MATTERS IS THE LAST ONE. Widening a type is trivial; the claim
// worth proving is that a BLOCK can now declare this from inside its own folder
// with no further spine edit — which is G11's whole promise applied to the
// model-facing half.
