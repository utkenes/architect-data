## What this is

This repository hosts **two sibling open-source engineering handbooks** under `content/`, sharing the same CC BY-SA 4.0 license, the same contribution workflow, and the same CI quality bar:

- **The HLD Handbook** (`content/hld/`) — an opinionated, end-to-end textbook on high-level software design, distributed systems, and modern infrastructure. 159 teaching chapters across 12 parts plus a 22-page Trade-offs Library — 181 pages, ~773,000 words, 719 Mermaid diagrams, 3,100+ citations. Equivalent in scope to a **~2,400-page book** — longer than *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* and Alex Xu's *System Design Interview* volumes 1+2 combined. Covers TCP/IP and the OS contract through to LLM serving, multi-agent orchestration, and post-quantum crypto.
- **The DSA Handbook** (`content/dsa/`) — a practice-first data-structures-and-algorithms curriculum aimed at coding interviews and competitive programming. 120 chapters across 15 parts plus 37 pattern decision pages, 5 long-form LC editorials, and 46 interactive widget specs. ~470,000 words, 226 Mermaid diagrams. Each chapter teaches a structure or pattern, then walks the canonical LeetCode problems, with sibling `sol.py` / `sol.java` / `sol.cpp` / `sol.go` files for 155 problems. Python is inlined in the chapter; the other three languages are linked.

> **More curricula are planned.** This repo is structured as an umbrella so additional handbooks (e.g. operating systems, databases, ML systems) can land alongside HLD and DSA over time, sharing the same workflow and license.

Every concept in either handbook is taught **inline** as a full-length article: introduction, first-principles explanation, diagrams, worked examples, trade-offs, production gotchas, citations to primary sources. No stubs. No "coming soon." No external blog redirects. No bullet outlines that tell you to go somewhere else to actually learn.

Every `.md` file under `content/` also renders natively on GitHub — all 945 Mermaid diagrams display in the GitHub UI, all footnotes work, all cross-references resolve. The websites add search, dark mode, per-chapter diagram zoom, social cards, OG images, the interactive DSA widgets, and fast client-side navigation.

Both handbooks are continuously updated. Every chapter's frontmatter declares `date_created` and `date_updated`, so you can see exactly how fresh each page is. We care about numbers being right today, not right in 2022.

## Reading the handbooks online

Each book has its own subdomain. The umbrella landing page links to both:

| Site | URL | What it serves |
|------|-----|----------------|
| **Landing page** | [handbook.academy](https://handbook.academy) | Two cards — pick HLD or DSA. |
| **HLD Handbook** | [hld.handbook.academy](https://hld.handbook.academy) | The full HLD curriculum. |
| **DSA Handbook** | [dsa.handbook.academy](https://dsa.handbook.academy) | The full DSA curriculum, with interactive widgets. |

Each subdomain serves one book at the root — URLs do not nest. HLD chapters live at `hld.handbook.academy/curriculum/...`, not `handbook.academy/hld/...`. Same for DSA.

## What's in this repo

This repository is the **canonical content source** for both books. PRs to either handbook are welcome.

- **[`content/hld/`](content/hld/)** — 159 HLD chapters across 12 parts + 22 trade-off decision pages. The chapter template is intro → first principles → diagrams → worked example → trade-offs → production gotchas → references. See [STYLE_GUIDE.md](STYLE_GUIDE.md).
- **[`content/dsa/`](content/dsa/)** — 120 DSA chapters across 15 parts. The chapter template is practice-first: cheat-sheet table, deep dive on the structure or pattern, prompt cards for representative LeetCode problems, and `<details>` solution + common-mistakes blocks. Code samples live as sibling files (`sol.py`, `sol.java`, `sol.cpp`, `sol.go`) under each chapter's directory. See [STYLE_GUIDE.md § DSA-specific deviations](STYLE_GUIDE.md#dsa-specific-deviations) and [`content/dsa/part-1-linear-data-structures/00-arrays.md`](content/dsa/part-1-linear-data-structures/00-arrays.md) as the canonical example.
- **`content/dsa/editorials/`** — long-form LeetCode editorials covering hard problems with multiple approaches.
- **`content/dsa/patterns/`** — pattern decision references that compare interchangeable approaches (e.g. recursion vs iteration, BFS vs DFS, sliding window vs prefix sum).
- **`content/dsa/widgets/`** — 46 YAML specs for the interactive widgets that render on the DSA website. On GitHub these are callouts that link to the spec; on the website the widget renders.
- **`content/dsa/_problem-registry.yml`** — canonical `LC-NNN` ID registry; the website source-of-truth for every LeetCode problem the curriculum touches.

## Why this exists

The open-source curricula for system design and DSA have a shape, and that shape is frustrating:

- **Link dumps** — curated lists that point at dozens of scattered blog posts, LeetCode discuss threads, and talks. Great for discovery, useless as a learning path. You end up with 60 tabs open and no through-line.
- **Teaser-and-redirect repos** — READMEs with a few hundred words on each topic that nudge you toward a paid course hosted elsewhere. The GitHub repo is the marketing page; the actual teaching is behind a $150-$400+/year paywall.
- **Monolithic READMEs frozen in time** — a single 5,000-line `README.md` that was great in 2021 but hasn't kept up with the modern stack. No LLM serving, no CRDTs, no post-quantum crypto, no FinOps. And nobody wants to review a PR against a 5,000-line file.
- **Surface-level outlines** — bullet-point summaries that tell you *what* exists without explaining *why* you'd pick one approach over another. You learn the vocabulary without the judgment.
- **Interview-only prep** — focused on passing a specific 45-minute screen, not on actually operating systems at scale or actually understanding the algorithm.

These handbooks fix all of that:

- **100% inline content.** Every chapter is a full teaching article written from scratch, living in this repo as plain Markdown. Nothing is a stub. Nothing redirects you elsewhere to learn.
- **Progressive curricula.** HLD has 159 teaching chapters across 12 parts plus a 22-page Trade-offs Library, sequenced from prerequisites (Part 0) to Staff+ topics. DSA has 120 chapters across 15 parts, from arrays to bitmask DP, with each part introducing a tighter pattern family. Each chapter declares its prerequisites, learning objectives, estimated reading time, and difficulty tier.
- **Research-backed.** Every HLD chapter ends with a **Further Reading & References** section citing primary sources — SIGMOD and OSDI papers, RFCs, IETF drafts, engineering postmortems, official docs, canonical books. **3,100+ citations** across HLD. DSA chapters cite the original papers behind each algorithm where they exist (Floyd, Tarjan, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Aho-Corasick).
- **Opinionated.** Every topic picks a recommended approach and explains *why*. Where reasonable people disagree, the trade-offs are made explicit — HLD has a dedicated 22-page Trade-offs Library; DSA has 37 pattern decision pages that compare interchangeable approaches (recursion vs iteration, BFS vs DFS, sliding window vs prefix sum, and so on).
- **Modern (2025+).** HLD covers LLM serving, RAG pipelines, AI agents, multi-agent orchestration, CRDTs, edge computing, FinOps, post-quantum cryptography, platform engineering, local-first software, differential privacy, MCP. DSA covers the modern competitive-programming toolkit: monotonic stacks/deques, Morris traversal, suffix arrays, Aho-Corasick, bitmask DP, randomised algorithms.
- **Practice-first for DSA.** Every DSA chapter ships with sibling code samples in **Python, Java, C++, and Go** for the canonical LeetCode problems it teaches. Python is inlined in the chapter; the other three languages are one click away. 155 LeetCode problems are covered in this format.
- **Interactive on the website.** The DSA book's 46 widget specs render as live, animated visualisations on `dsa.handbook.academy` (sliding windows that you can drag, monotonic stacks that animate the pop sequence, etc.). On GitHub the widget callouts link to the YAML spec.

## Who this is for

These handbooks are written for:

- **SDE1 engineers preparing for SDE2 interviews.** Read **DSA Parts 0-9** for coding-round fluency, then **HLD Part 0 + Part 1 + Part 11**, plus 8-10 targeted case studies from HLD Part 8, plus the top-5 most-cited trade-off pages.
- **SDE2s preparing for Senior/Staff.** The full **HLD Parts 3-7** are the core "you need to know this to design anything meaningful" material. Parts 6 (Reliability) and 7 (Security) separate Senior candidates from Staff candidates. **DSA Part 14** covers narration and trade-off articulation in the algorithmic round.
- **Senior/Staff engineers refreshing or filling gaps.** **HLD Part 9** (AI/ML systems) and the Trade-offs Library are valuable even if you've been doing this for 15 years. Modern LLM serving and vector search weren't a thing when most of us learned backend.
- **Self-taught engineers without a CS degree** who want the vocabulary and the reasoning that bootcamps and YouTube don't teach. **HLD Part 0** is explicit prerequisites: TCP/IP, the OS contract, database internals, API design. **DSA Part 0** is the foundations — Big-O, recursion, bit manipulation — before pattern-matching becomes useful.
- **Career switchers** moving from adjacent roles (frontend → backend, backend → infra, SWE → MLE) who need to build system-level intuition fast.
- **Competitive programmers and ICPC/Codeforces contestants** who want a structured reference for the algorithmic toolkit (KMP, Aho-Corasick, suffix arrays, segment trees, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, DP variants).
- **Teachers and course creators** who want to build curriculum without writing thousands of pages from scratch. The CC BY-SA 4.0 license explicitly allows this.
- **Anyone operating a production system at non-trivial scale** who wants a reference shelf that covers the full stack — from packet-level networking to multi-tenant SaaS isolation models.

**These handbooks are NOT for:**

- **Absolute beginners with no programming experience.** HLD Part 0 assumes you can read code and have built at least one CRUD app. DSA Part 0 assumes you can write a `for` loop and a recursive function. If you're brand new, start with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) or [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/), then come back.
- **People who want low-level language-specific tutorials.** We don't teach Rust syntax or Go's goroutines — we teach concepts that apply across languages.

Pick one:

**I want a quick HLD taste.** Read these three in order — they give you the vocabulary and the first real worked example:

1. [Scalability: Growing a System Without Breaking It](content/hld/part-1-core-fundamentals/00-scalability.md)
2. [Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation](content/hld/part-1-core-fundamentals/04-back-of-envelope-estimation.md)
3. [Design a URL Shortener (TinyURL / bit.ly)](content/hld/part-8-case-studies/00-url-shortener.md)

**I want a quick DSA taste.** Read these three to see the chapter shape and the sibling-code workflow:

1. [Arrays: static, dynamic, multi-dimensional](content/dsa/part-1-linear-data-structures/00-arrays.md)
2. [Two pointers: opposite ends](content/dsa/part-3-pointers-window-prefix/00-two-pointers-opposite.md)
3. [Sliding window: variable size](content/dsa/part-3-pointers-window-prefix/03-sliding-window-variable.md)

**I'm preparing for an SDE2 interview in the next 6 weeks.** Follow the [SDE1 → SDE2 study plan](#sde1--sde2--6-week-interview-prep).

**I'm a Senior engineer refreshing my distributed-systems foundations.** Read [HLD Part 3 — Distributed Systems Theory](#part-3--distributed-systems-theory-11-chapters) straight through.

**I want to learn AI-systems design.** Read [HLD Part 9 — AI & ML System Design](#part-9--ai--ml-system-design-15-chapters) + the 8 AI case studies in [Part 8](#part-8--case-studies-56-chapters) (chapters 30-37).

**I want to grind interview algorithms.** Open [the DSA curriculum](#the-full-dsa-curriculum). Read Parts 0-2 in order, then jump into the pattern parts (3-9) as the problems you encounter call for them.

**I want to read both books cover-to-cover.** Start at [HLD Part 0](#part-0--prerequisites-5-chapters) for the systems track and [DSA Part 0](#the-full-dsa-curriculum) for the algorithms track. At one 25-minute chapter per day, the whole repo is roughly a year of reading.

<summary><strong>Part 0 — Prerequisites (5 chapters)</strong> — networking, OS, data structures, databases, API design</summary>

### Part 0 — Prerequisites (5 chapters)

> **Audience:** engineers without a CS degree, or anyone who wants to confirm their foundations before moving on.
> **Difficulty:** Beginner. **Total reading time:** ~3 hours.

Foundational topics that the rest of the handbook assumes. If you can explain TCP's three-way handshake, the difference between a process and a thread, a B-tree's internal structure, and why idempotent PUT is better than non-idempotent POST for a retry-prone endpoint — you can skip this part.

1. [Networking Fundamentals for System Design](content/hld/part-0-prerequisites/00-networking-fundamentals.md) — OSI and TCP/IP layers, TCP vs UDP, HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 vs HTTP/3, DNS resolution, TLS handshake, what "the network is unreliable" really means in practice.
2. [Operating System Essentials for System Design](content/hld/part-0-prerequisites/01-os-essentials.md) — Processes vs threads, context switching cost, virtual memory, page cache, filesystem I/O, epoll/kqueue/IOCP, why `O_DIRECT` matters for databases.
3. [Data Structures for Distributed Systems](content/hld/part-0-prerequisites/02-data-structures-for-systems.md) — Hash tables, B-trees, LSM-trees, skip lists, Bloom filters, tries, HyperLogLog, Count-Min Sketch, and when each shows up in real systems.
4. [Database Fundamentals for System Design](content/hld/part-0-prerequisites/03-database-fundamentals.md) — Transactions, isolation levels (read-committed to serializable), indexes, query planners, joins, and why your ORM hides things from you that you need to see.
5. [API Design Basics: REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and the Hard Parts](content/hld/part-0-prerequisites/04-api-design-basics.md) — Resource modeling, idempotency, versioning, pagination, rate-limit headers, error envelopes, HATEOAS in theory vs practice.

> **Difficulty:** Beginner-Intermediate. **Total reading time:** ~4 hours.

The vocabulary and the reasoning habits that every later chapter assumes. "Scalability," "consistency," "trade-off," and "back-of-envelope" get defined here rigorously so they mean something specific when we use them later.

### Part 2 — Building Blocks (16 chapters)

> **Audience:** anyone who'll assemble backend systems. This part is the Lego brick inventory.
> **Difficulty:** Intermediate. **Total reading time:** ~10 hours.

Deep dives on the pieces you assemble to build real systems: load balancers, caches, queues, CDNs, databases (SQL and NoSQL), partitioning, replication, pub/sub, rate limiters, service discovery, blob storage, geospatial indexes, and edge compute.

## The full DSA curriculum

**120 chapters across 15 parts, plus 37 pattern decision pages, 5 long-form editorials, and 46 interactive widget specs.** Each chapter is centered on a specific data structure or algorithmic pattern, taught with worked LeetCode problems. Sibling `sol.py` / `sol.java` / `sol.cpp` / `sol.go` files live under each problem directory; the Python solution is inlined in the chapter, the others are linked. Editorials, pattern decision diagrams, and widget YAML specs are siblings under `content/dsa/`.

Each part below is collapsed by default — click to expand the chapter list. Linking to a specific part from elsewhere in the README auto-expands it on GitHub.

> **Difficulty:** Beginner-Intermediate. **Total reading time:** ~5 hours.

How to find things and how to order things. Linear search and when it's actually the right answer; the canonical binary search written without off-by-one bugs; the lower_bound / upper_bound / peak / rotated-array variants; the comparison-sort family (insertion, merge, quicksort with the production hybrids like Timsort and Introsort); heap sort and why `n log n` is the comparison-sort lower bound; the linear-time sorts (counting, radix, bucket); and quickselect for the top-k problems.

> **Audience:** anyone whose nested-loop solutions keep timing out.
> **Difficulty:** Intermediate. **Total reading time:** ~4 hours.

Three closely related patterns that all amount to "walk the array smarter": opposite-ends two pointers (Container With Most Water, 3Sum), same-direction two pointers, fixed and variable sliding windows, prefix sums and difference arrays, and the prefix-sum + hash-map combo for "subarray sum equals K"-shaped problems.

> **Difficulty:** Intermediate. **Total reading time:** ~3 hours.

Stack and queue *as algorithmic patterns*, not just data structures. Monotonic stacks (Daily Temperatures, Largest Rectangle in Histogram), monotonic deques (Sliding Window Maximum), min/max stacks (O(1) min query under push/pop), expression parsing (Shunting-Yard / RPN), and the queue-from-stacks amortization argument.

Linked lists are pointer surgery. Sentinel-node patterns, the canonical iterative reversal (and the recursive cousin), reverse-in-groups-of-k, Floyd's tortoise-and-hare cycle detection (and why the cycle-start formula works), merging sorted lists, and the LRU cache as the canonical hash-map + doubly-linked-list combo.

<summary><strong>Part 13 — Design the Data Structure (7 chapters)</strong> — LRU/LFU, min stacks, hit counter, trie autocomplete, Twitter feed, game state</summary>

### Part 13 — Design the Data Structure (7 chapters)

> **Audience:** SDE2+ candidates — "design X" is the staple senior-coding-round question type.
> **Difficulty:** Intermediate-Advanced. **Total reading time:** ~5 hours.

The bridge between DSA and HLD: how to compose primitives into APIs that meet a per-operation complexity contract. The full LRU treatment with concurrency and multi-tier framing; LFU via frequency-bucketed doubly-linked lists; min stacks and max-frequency stacks; hit counters and rate limiters; trie-backed autocomplete; Twitter-feed design; and a game-state design vignette.

<summary><strong>Part 14 — Interview Framework (12 chapters)</strong> — pattern recognition, clarifying questions, communicating, complexity, mocks, per-company tracks</summary>

### Part 14 — Interview Framework (12 chapters)

> **Audience:** anyone within a month of an actual interview window.
> **Difficulty:** All levels. **Total reading time:** ~5 hours.

The meta-skills that turn a correct solution into a passing one. Pattern-recognition drills; the first-five-minutes clarifying-questions script; how to narrate while you code; how to discuss complexity convincingly; running productive mock interviews; the most common pitfalls; Amazon Leadership Principles (brief and narration); the Meta AI-assisted round (format, prompting tactics, common failures); and the per-company tracks index that points at company-specific reading lists.

## Study plans

You don't need one — pick any chapter and start reading. These are here if you prefer a pre-built route, typically because you're preparing for a specific interview window or filling a specific gap.

### SDE1 → SDE2 — 6-week interview prep

Goal: pass a 45-60 minute system-design screen at a mid-to-senior level. Roughly 8-10 hours of reading per week.

| Week  | Focus                       | Chapters                                                                              |
| ----- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | Foundations                 | [Part 0](#part-0--prerequisites-5-chapters) + [Part 1](#part-1--core-fundamentals-7-chapters) (12 chapters, ~7 hrs) |
| **2** | Building blocks I           | Part 2 chapters 0-7: load balancers, proxies, CDN, cache, SQL, NoSQL, partitioning, replication |
| **3** | Building blocks II          | Part 2 chapters 8-15: queues, pub/sub, real-time, rate limiting, service mesh, blob storage, geo, edge |
| **4** | Case studies (core)         | Pick 5 from Part 8 chapters 0-9: URL shortener, rate limiter, chat, feed, web crawler, autocomplete |
| **5** | Case studies (your target)  | Pick 5 more from Part 8 relevant to your target company (see [Company-Specific Flavors](content/hld/part-11-interview-framework/04-company-specific-flavors.md)) |
| **6** | Interview mechanics         | [Part 11](#part-11--interview-framework-6-chapters) + top 5 most-cited pages in [Trade-offs Library](#trade-offs-library-22-pages) |

### SDE2 → Senior — 3-month deep dive

Goal: operate at Senior level, own cross-team architecture, pass loops at Senior+ bars.

| Phase   | Focus                                           | Duration  |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **1**   | Foundations + building blocks                   | 3 weeks — [Parts 0-2](#part-0--prerequisites-5-chapters) (28 chapters) |
| **2**   | Distributed theory + data + architecture        | 4 weeks — [Parts 3, 4, 5](#part-3--distributed-systems-theory-11-chapters) (32 chapters) |
| **3**   | Case studies (all 56)                           | 4 weeks — [Part 8](#part-8--case-studies-56-chapters) |
| **4**   | Reliability, security, AI, frontier, interview  | 2 weeks — [Parts 6, 7, 9, 10, 11](#part-6--reliability--operations-11-chapters) + [Trade-offs Library](#trade-offs-library-22-pages) |

### Full curriculum — Staff+ preparation (6 months)

Read everything in order. Use the end-of-chapter questions for active recall. Average one 25-minute chapter per day gets you through the whole thing in about 6 months, with buffer for harder chapters and re-reading.

### AI/ML-only track (4 weeks)

If you already know the fundamentals and want to become fluent specifically in AI-systems design:

| Week | Focus                | Chapters |
| ---- | -------------------- | -------- |
| 1    | LLM serving + RAG    | [Part 9](#part-9--ai--ml-system-design-15-chapters) chapters 0-3 |
| 2    | Agents + evaluation  | [Part 9](#part-9--ai--ml-system-design-15-chapters) chapters 3-9 |
| 3    | AI case studies      | [Part 8](#part-8--case-studies-56-chapters) chapters 30-37 (ChatGPT, RAG, coding agent, Perplexity, voice, moderation, semantic cache, model router) |
| 4    | ML fundamentals      | [Part 9](#part-9--ai--ml-system-design-15-chapters) chapters 9-14 + [Recommendation System case study](content/hld/part-8-case-studies/17-recommendation-system.md) |

### Interview-triage track (one weekend)

If you have a loop on Monday:

- Saturday morning: [How to Approach a System Design Question](content/hld/part-1-core-fundamentals/05-how-to-approach-design-questions.md) + [Back-of-the-Envelope Estimation](content/hld/part-1-core-fundamentals/04-back-of-envelope-estimation.md) + [Requirements Scoping](content/hld/part-11-interview-framework/01-requirements-scoping.md) + [Diagramming Skills](content/hld/part-11-interview-framework/02-diagramming-skills.md)
- Saturday afternoon: 3 case studies in your domain
- Sunday morning: 3 more case studies + [Trade-off Articulation](content/hld/part-11-interview-framework/03-trade-off-articulation.md)
- Sunday evening: [Company-Specific Interview Flavors](content/hld/part-11-interview-framework/04-company-specific-flavors.md) for your target

For comparison, the HLD book alone is longer than *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* (~600 pages) + Alex Xu's *System Design Interview* Vol. 1 (~300 pages) + Vol. 2 (~340 pages) combined. The DSA book is comparable in length to *Cracking the Coding Interview* (~700 pages) plus *Elements of Programming Interviews* (~480 pages).

## Quality standards

Every chapter in this repository passes 7 automated CI checks on every PR. The validators run against both books and dispatch on a per-book schema:

1. **[markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)** — Markdown style and structure conformance.
2. **[typos](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos)** — source-code spell-check with a project-specific allowlist for technical terms.
3. **Citation integrity** — every `[^1]`-style footnote has a corresponding `[^1]: source` definition; every citation is a real URL; no orphan citations.
4. **Frontmatter validation** — HLD chapters declare `title`, `difficulty`, `prerequisites`, `date_created`, `date_updated`, `reading_time_minutes`, `tags` (canonical taxonomy), and `technologies` (curated allowlist). DSA chapters declare `title`, `slug`, `part`, `chapter`, `difficulty`, `languages` (subset of `python`/`java`/`cpp`/`go`), `canonical_test`, `widgets`, and `ladder` (referencing `LC-NNN` IDs in `_problem-registry.yml`). Editorials and pattern decision pages have their own thinner schemas. See [`scripts/check-frontmatter.mjs`](scripts/check-frontmatter.mjs) for the per-book branches.
5. **Mermaid diagram validation** — all 945 diagrams across both books must parse with `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` on CI so broken syntax doesn't ship.
6. **[Vale](https://vale.sh/)** — prose-style linter for voice, passive voice, weasel words, and banned phrases. Custom rules in `.vale.ini`.
7. **[lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee)** — external link checker run weekly; flags rotted URLs so citations stay valid.

CI configuration lives in [`.github/workflows/content-ci.yml`](.github/workflows/content-ci.yml). Validator scripts are in [`scripts/`](scripts/).

Beyond automation, every chapter is reviewed for:

- Internal consistency (terminology matches Part 1 definitions)
- Difficulty calibration (a "Beginner" chapter doesn't assume Staff-level context)
- Diagram quality (Mermaid, not screenshots; captioned; accessibility-tagged)
- Citation quality (primary sources preferred over summarizing blog posts)

### How to contribute

1. **Read the [STYLE_GUIDE.md](STYLE_GUIDE.md)** for voice, structure, diagram conventions, and citation format.
2. **Open an issue first** for anything bigger than 30 minutes of work — this ensures you don't duplicate in-flight work.
3. **Fork, branch, edit.** Use descriptive branch names like `fix/raft-quorum-math` or `add/mcp-protocol-chapter`.
4. **Run validators locally (optional):**

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run check:all
   ```

   If you skip this, CI will run them on your PR anyway and tell you what to fix.
5. **Submit a pull request** using the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). Small fix? A one-sentence description is fine. Full chapter? Describe the pedagogical approach and list your primary sources.
6. **Respond to review.** A maintainer will review within 7 days (usually faster). For content chapters, expect at least one round of technical review.

### What makes a great contribution

- **Correctness.** If you're citing a number, cite the primary source. If you're claiming a property (like "Raft guarantees linearizability"), cite the paper.
- **Clarity.** Write for the difficulty tier declared in the chapter's frontmatter. Don't introduce Part-7 concepts in a Part-0 chapter.
- **Opinion with evidence.** If you think the chapter should recommend something different, make the case with citations, not vibes.
- **Pedagogical structure.** Intro → first principles → diagram → worked example → trade-offs → production gotchas → references. Deviate only when the topic genuinely demands it.

### Reviewers wanted

If you have **operated one of the systems we cover in Part 8** (payment processing, real-time chat, feeds, video streaming, etc.) — your review is worth more than a month of solo research. Open an issue with your expertise area and which chapter you'd like to review.

### Private/sensitive concerns

- **Security issues in validator scripts or CI:** open a [private security advisory](https://github.com/handbook-academy/engineering-handbook/security/advisories/new).
- **Code of conduct concerns:** email [hello@handbook.academy](mailto:hello@handbook.academy).

## Development setup

You don't need anything installed to contribute content — edit Markdown, push, let CI validate. But if you want to run the checks locally before pushing:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/) (the `.nvmrc` file pins the exact version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (ships with Node)
- Optional: [Vale](https://vale.sh/) for prose-style linting
- Optional: [lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee) for link checking

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/handbook-academy/engineering-handbook.git
cd engineering-handbook
nvm use                    # pins Node version from .nvmrc
npm install                # installs markdownlint, @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli, etc.
```

### Common commands

```bash
# Run all 7 content checks (same as CI)
npm run check:all

# Individual checks
npm run lint               # markdownlint
npm run check:citations    # footnote integrity
npm run check:frontmatter  # YAML schema
npm run check:mermaid      # Mermaid diagram syntax
npm run check:typos        # spell-check
npm run check:links        # lychee link check (slow; runs weekly)

# Optional
npm run prose              # Vale prose-style linter (requires Vale installed)
npm run stats              # word / diagram / citation counts
```

### Editor

Use **[Markdownlab](https://markdownlab.vercel.app)** ([source](https://github.com/invincible04/markdownlab)) for editing chapters. It's a browser-based Markdown editor with live preview, Mermaid rendering, and the same callouts/footnotes/admonitions this handbook uses — no install, no setup.

**Open any chapter directly in the editor** by prefixing its GitHub URL with `https://markdownlab.vercel.app/`:

```text
https://markdownlab.vercel.app/https://github.com/handbook-academy/engineering-handbook/blob/main/content/hld/part-1-core-fundamentals/00-scalability.md
```

That URL opens the chapter in Markdownlab pre-loaded and ready to edit. Paste your edits back into a fork → branch → PR.

The repo includes `.editorconfig`, `.nvmrc`, `.markdownlint.json`, `.vale.ini`, and `.typos.toml` so any editor that reads them picks up project settings automatically.

## Governance

**Benevolent maintainer model.** The project is currently solo-maintained by [@invincible04](https://github.com/invincible04). Major architectural decisions (curriculum scope, licensing, CI strategy) are made by the maintainer after consultation with active contributors via Issues/Discussions.

**Decision process:**

- **Typo / dead link / factual correction:** any maintainer can merge.
- **New chapter or major rewrite:** requires an issue with pedagogical rationale and at least one maintainer approval.
- **Curriculum scope change (new part, renamed part, reordering):** requires a Discussion thread open for at least 7 days before merge.
- **License change:** requires all-contributors consent; CC BY-SA 4.0 for everything in this repository is a stable commitment.

**Becoming a maintainer.** Sustained, high-quality contributions over 3+ months can result in a maintainer invitation. This includes merge rights on your areas of expertise and a vote on curriculum-scope decisions.

See [CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS) for the current maintainer routing.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this really free?</strong></summary>

Yes, and specifically: everything in this repository — both books' content, writing guides, style guide, validator scripts — is released under **CC BY-SA 4.0**. Anyone (including us) can share and adapt it, but adaptations must carry the same license. That means the chapter text cannot be paywalled by anybody — not by us, not by a future company, not by anyone who forks this repo. You can always read both books free at [handbook.academy](https://handbook.academy).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this to build a paid course?</strong></summary>

Yes. CC BY-SA 4.0 allows commercial use provided you:

1. Attribute the original ("Adapted from The Engineering Handbook, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://github.com/handbook-academy/engineering-handbook")
2. License your derivative under the same CC BY-SA 4.0 terms
3. Indicate what you changed

You can teach courses, run boot camps, build YouTube channels, or sell books derived from this content — under share-alike. What you *can't* do is take the content, strip the attribution, and relicense it as proprietary.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I translate it into my language?</strong></summary>

**Please do.** Translations are explicitly welcomed. Open an issue saying which language you'd like to translate into and which chapters you plan to start with. Translations live in parallel directories (e.g. `content-hi/` for Hindi, `content-zh/` for Chinese) under the same repository, or as a linked sister repo — your call.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from `donnemartin/system-design-primer`?</strong></summary>

`system-design-primer` is a link-dump README that points at scattered blog posts and talks. It's great as a discovery tool. The HLD Handbook in this repo is inline content — every topic is taught fully within these pages. They're complementary: `system-design-primer` for breadth of resources, this handbook for depth of teaching.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from Alex Xu's books?</strong></summary>

Alex Xu's books are excellent and we cite them in nearly every case study. The differences:

- **Scope:** ~640 pages (Vols 1+2) vs ~2,400 equivalent pages of HLD here.
- **Freshness:** Xu Vol. 2 was published in 2022 and doesn't cover LLMs, RAG, agents, CRDTs, post-quantum crypto, MCP, etc. This handbook does.
- **Format:** Xu is case-study-focused. This handbook has 56 case studies *plus* 103 foundational HLD chapters that teach the building blocks.
- **License:** Xu's books are copyrighted and paid. This handbook is CC BY-SA 4.0.
- **Community:** Xu's books are one-author; this handbook accepts PRs.
- **Bonus:** this repo also includes a 120-chapter DSA curriculum.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is the DSA book different from NeetCode / LeetCode editorials / "Cracking the Coding Interview"?</strong></summary>

- **Structured by pattern, not by problem.** Every DSA chapter is a *teaching* chapter on a structure or pattern (e.g. monotonic stack, sliding-window-variable, segment tree). LeetCode problems show up as worked examples *inside* the chapter, not as the unit of study.
- **Four languages, side by side.** Each canonical problem ships with `sol.py`, `sol.java`, `sol.cpp`, `sol.go` siblings. You read the chapter in Python, then click through to your interview language without re-deriving the logic.
- **37 pattern decision pages.** When a problem could be solved by recursion *or* iteration, BFS *or* DFS, sliding window *or* prefix sum — there's a pattern decision page that compares them and tells you which to reach for first. This is the part NeetCode skips.
- **Interactive widgets.** On `dsa.handbook.academy`, the relevant chapters render live, animated visualisations for sliding windows, monotonic stacks, Morris traversal, quickselect partitioning, and so on. Useful when the words on the page aren't enough.
- **Open and editable.** CTCI is paywalled and frozen at one author's voice. This is CC BY-SA 4.0 and accepts PRs.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this the same as the websites at hld.handbook.academy and dsa.handbook.academy?</strong></summary>

The **content** is identical. The websites add a polished reading UI: full-text search, dark mode, syntax-highlighted code blocks, per-chapter diagram zoom, social cards, OG images, fast client-side navigation, and — on the DSA site — the live interactive widgets. Same content, better reading experience — and still free, with no sign-up.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why don't you include an "Awesome" list of external resources?</strong></summary>

We cite primary sources inline where they're relevant. A separate "awesome" list would duplicate that work and go stale faster. If a resource is worth reading, it's cited in a chapter's References section.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I want to submit a chapter on [topic X]. How?</strong></summary>

Open an issue first with the [writing template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) explaining:

1. Which part this chapter belongs in
2. Why it belongs (not already covered? modern emerging topic? missing from Part X?)
3. Proposed outline (1-2 paragraphs)
4. Your primary sources

A maintainer will respond with scope feedback within a week. Once approved, fork → draft → PR. For Part 8 chapters use [`writing-guides/case-study-template.md`](writing-guides/case-study-template.md); for trade-off pages use [`writing-guides/trade-off-template.md`](writing-guides/trade-off-template.md). All other chapters follow the skeleton documented in [STYLE_GUIDE.md](STYLE_GUIDE.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I cite this in an academic paper?</strong></summary>

Use the BibTeX entry in the [Citation](#citation) section below, or the `CITATION.cff` file (which academic tools like Zotero and Zenodo can parse directly).
</details>

## Acknowledgments

This project stands on the shoulders of many, and we cite primary sources liberally throughout. A few that shaped the handbook most:

**Canonical books — HLD:**

- **Martin Kleppmann** — [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) is the foundation underneath most of HLD Parts 3-4.
- **Alex Xu** — [System Design Interview](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF) Volumes 1 and 2 defined the interview case-study format we build on in HLD Part 8.

- **Jon Bentley** — [Programming Pearls](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Pearls-2nd-Jon-Bentley/dp/0201657880) is the spirit behind the prompt cards.
- **Steven & Felix Halim** — [Competitive Programming](https://cpbook.net/) for the contest-driven techniques in DSA Parts 9, 11, and 12.
- **Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Amit Prakash** — [Elements of Programming Interviews](https://elementsofprogramminginterviews.com/) for the problem-shaping that influenced the DSA prompt cards.
- **Gayle Laakmann McDowell** — [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) for setting the bar on interview-style explanations.

**Open-source references:**

- **Donne Martin** — [system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer).
- **NeetCode** — [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/) and the NeetCode 150 problem list for the DSA practice ladder template.
- **LeetCode community** — for the canonical problem corpus and the editorial conventions we adapt.
- **The Kubernetes, CNCF, and OpenTelemetry communities** — for cloud-native and observability standards.
- **The Apache projects** (Kafka, Cassandra, Hadoop, Spark, Flink) — for foundational distributed-systems code and docs.

**Papers, RFCs, and postmortems:**

- **SIGMOD / VLDB / OSDI / SOSP / NSDI** papers — the bedrock of distributed systems.
- **IETF / W3C / IANA** — for networking and web standards.
- **Every engineer who has written a public postmortem.** Real outages taught us everything about graceful degradation, blast radius, and the limits of testing.

We teach the same concepts in our own words, with our own diagrams, and we cite the originals.
