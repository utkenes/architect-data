// ── blocks/escalation/project — TWO pure projections of the SAME slice ─────
// SITE 2 OF 3 (the view row match) and SITE 3 OF 3 (the context line match) for a
// new TicketStatus variant (§11.2). Both are closed matches with NO else arm, so
// the compiler's edit list for `Archived(ticket, at)` is exactly these three sites,
// all inside blocks/escalation/. Zero sites outside the block.
//
// This is also G12's fix in place: `t.status is Open` as a way to compute
// `canEscalate` is NOT a closed match — it compiles happily after a variant is
// added and silently answers the wrong thing.
