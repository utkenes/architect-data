# Developer Persistent Memory Standards

> **Language**: English | [繁體中文](../locales/zh-TW/core/developer-memory.md)

**Version**: 1.1.1
**Last Updated**: 2026-06-18
**Applicability**: All software projects using AI assistants
**Scope**: universal
**Owning Spec**: XSPEC-291 (developer-memory has no dedicated feature XSPEC; XSPEC-291 owns it)
**Industry Standards**: None (UDS original)

---

## Purpose

This standard defines a structured system for capturing, retrieving, and surfacing developer experience insights (pitfalls, patterns, anti-patterns, mental models, etc.) across conversations and projects. It enables AI assistants to proactively leverage accumulated knowledge, reducing repeated mistakes and accelerating problem-solving.

## 3. Four Operations

### 3.1 Record (記錄)

#### Input Process

1. Developer describes an insight in natural language
2. AI structures it into the memory schema
3. Developer confirms or edits the structured entry
4. Entry is saved to the memory store

#### 30-Second Rule

Every memory entry must answer three questions:

| Question | Maps To |
|----------|---------|
| What is the specific problem? | `insight` |
| Why does it happen? | `context` + `anti_pattern` |
| How to fix/avoid it? | `resolution` |

#### Recording Levels

| Level | Fields | When to Use |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Level 1: Quick | `insight`, `category`, `tags` | Quick note, will refine later |
| Level 2: Contextual | Level 1 + `context`, `anti_pattern`, `resolution` | Standard recording |
| Level 3: Refined | Level 2 + `example`, `triggers`, `applicability` | Important, frequently-used insight |

#### De-identification

Before storing, remove project-specific details:

| Remove | Keep |
|--------|------|
| API keys, secrets | Technical pattern |
| Project names, internal URLs | Framework/library names |
| Team member names | Language/version information |
| Proprietary business logic | Generic business logic pattern |

### 3.2 Query (查詢)

#### Search Methods

| Method | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Keyword | Free-text search across `insight`, `context`, `tags` | `"async race condition"` |
| Tag | Exact match on `tags` field | `tags: ["react", "hooks"]` |
| Category | Filter by category type | `category: pitfall` |
| Language | Filter by `applicability.languages` | `languages: ["python"]` |
| Confidence | Filter by confidence threshold | `confidence >= 0.7` |
| Combined | Multiple filters combined | `category: pitfall AND tags: ["react"]` |

#### Query Result Sorting

| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | Relevance to current context |
| 2 | Confidence score (highest first) |
| 3 | Hit rate (`times_useful / times_surfaced`) |
| 4 | Recency (`created_at` newest first) |

### 3.3 Feedback (回饋)

#### Feedback Actions

| Action | Effect on `confidence` | Effect on `stats` |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| `valid` | +0.05 (cap at 1.0) | `times_useful += 1` |
| `invalid` | -0.15 (floor at 0.0) | `times_not_useful += 1` |
| `needs-revision` | -0.05 (floor at 0.0) | No change |

#### Confidence Adjustment Rules

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 3 consecutive `valid` | Bonus +0.05 |
| 3 consecutive `invalid` | Flag for review |
| `confidence < 0.2` | Flag for retirement |
| `confidence > 0.9` after 10+ uses | Mark as "proven" |

### 3.4 Review (審查)

AI scans the memory store and generates a review report covering:

#### Merge Suggestions

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Two entries with >80% semantic similarity | Suggest merge |
| Same `tags` + same `category` + similar `insight` | Suggest merge |
| Merged entries inherit highest `confidence` | Preserve both feedback logs |

#### Retirement Suggestions

Thresholds are UDS defaults (configurable per project); the rationale is
recorded so each value is auditable rather than arbitrary.

| Trigger | Action | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| `confidence < 0.2` | Suggest retirement | Repeatedly invalidated knowledge is more noise than signal |
| Not surfaced in 180+ days AND `confidence < 0.5` | Suggest retirement | Half-year dormancy combined with low confidence means the memory is no longer relevant to active work; the 180-day window matches the staleness/decay model in Staleness Detection below |
| 5+ `invalid` feedback entries | Suggest retirement | Sustained negative feedback signals the memory is wrong or obsolete |

#### Staleness Detection

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `validity.type == "versioned"` AND version is outdated | Flag as stale |
| `validity.type == "temporal"` AND `expires_at` passed | Flag as expired |
| `validity.type == "evergreen"` | Skip version check |

#### Revision Suggestions

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| 2+ `needs-revision` feedback | Suggest revision |
| High `times_surfaced` but low `times_useful` ratio | Suggest revision |

---

## 4. Proactive Behavior Protocol

### 4.1 Memory Surfacing (主動浮現)

#### When to Surface

| Timing | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Conversation start | Scan memory store, show top 3 relevant to stated task |
| During development | Detect code patterns, error messages, or tech decisions that match `triggers` |
| Before committing | Surface relevant pitfalls for changed files/patterns |

#### Surfacing Rules

| Rule | Value | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Relevance threshold | > 0.7 | Avoid noise from loosely-related memories |
| Cooldown period | 7 days per entry | Prevent repetitive suggestions |
| Max per trigger | 3–5 entries | Information overload prevention |
| Overflow handling | AI summarizes into grouped insight | When > 5 matches found |

#### Surfacing Format

```
💡 Memory Match [MEM-2026-0042] (confidence: 0.85)
Category: pitfall | Tags: async, promise
Insight: Promise.all rejects on first failure — use Promise.allSettled for partial results
Context: When processing batch API calls where partial success is acceptable
```

### 4.2 Memory Extraction (主動萃取)

#### Trigger Signals

AI should detect these developer signals and suggest recording:

| Signal | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Repeated modification | Same code block edited 3+ times |
| Revert | `git revert` or manual undo |
| Insight language | "Oh!", "I see", "原來", "終於", "the trick is..." |
| Long debugging session | 10+ minutes on same error |
| Solution after struggle | Error → multiple attempts → resolution |

#### Extraction Flow

```
1. AI detects signal
2. AI proposes: "It seems you discovered something. Want to record this insight?"
3. AI pre-structures the entry based on conversation context
4. Developer confirms / edits / skips
5. If confirmed → saved to memory store
```

### 4.3 Memory Aggregation (主動聚合)

#### Aggregation Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| 3+ related `pitfall` entries | Suggest grouping into a `mental-model` |
| 5+ entries with same tag | Suggest creating a topic summary |
| Scattered fragments about same concept | Suggest consolidation |

#### Upgrade Path

```
Multiple pitfalls → Pattern → Mental Model
  (fragments)     (solution)  (understanding)
```

## 5. Memory Verification Principle（記憶是線索，非結論）

> 借鑑 lintsinghua/claude-code-book 記憶驗證原則。

記憶提供方向，但**不能直接作為事實使用**。使用記憶前須獨立驗證：

| 記憶內容 | 驗證方法 | 衝突時處理 |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| 檔案路徑 | 確認檔案仍存在（Glob/Read） | 標記記憶為 `needs-revision` |
| 函式名稱/API flag | 確認仍存在（Grep/文件） | 標記記憶為 `needs-revision` |
| 架構快照/Repo 狀態 | 優先信任 `git log`/原始碼 | 更新記憶為當前狀態 |
| 套件版本/相依 | 確認 package.json/lockfile | 以實際版本為準 |

### 禁止行為

- 直接引用記憶中的具體 API/路徑/函式名稱推薦給使用者，未先驗證
- 宣稱「根據記憶，X 存在」而未執行獨立確認
- 因記憶內容與現況衝突時，選擇信任記憶而非當前觀察

### 記憶用途場景

記憶適合提供：
- **搜尋方向**：「這類問題上次在 X 模組找到答案」
- **模式線索**：「這個錯誤模式對應已知 pitfall MEM-2026-0042」
- **決策背景**：「此設計決策的歷史背景是...」

## 6. Noise Control

### Push Levels

| Level | Name | Behavior |
|-------|------|----------|
| 0 | Silent | Never push; only respond to queries |
| 1 | Summary | Show count: "3 relevant memories found. Want to see them?" |
| 2 | Active (default) | Show top 3 with one-line summaries |
| 3 | Detailed | Show full entries with context and examples |

### Noise Reduction Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Feedback-driven | If user marks 3+ surfaced memories as `invalid`, reduce to Level 1 |
| Session respect | After user says "not now", switch to Level 0 for current session |
| Confidence filter | Only surface entries with `confidence >= 0.5` |
| Proven bias | Prioritize entries with "proven" status (confidence > 0.9, 10+ uses) |

---

## 6. Cross-Language Applicability

### Applicability Schema

```yaml
applicability:
  languages: ["javascript", "typescript"]  # Applicable languages (empty = universal)
  frameworks: ["react", "next.js"]          # Applicable frameworks (empty = any)
  universal: false                           # true = applies to all languages
  exclusions: ["rust"]                       # Languages where this explicitly does NOT apply
```

### Applicability Rules

| Scenario | `universal` | `languages` | `exclusions` |
|----------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Applies to all languages | `true` | `[]` | `[]` |
| Language-specific | `false` | `["python", "ruby"]` | `[]` |
| All except some | `true` | `[]` | `["c", "assembly"]` |
| Framework-specific | `false` | `["javascript"]` | `[]` |

## 7. Knowledge Lifecycle

### Validity Types

| Type | Description | Staleness Check |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `evergreen` | Always applicable (e.g., algorithm insight) | None |
| `versioned` | Tied to specific version (e.g., API behavior) | Check `version_bound` |
| `temporal` | Time-limited (e.g., workaround for a bug) | Check `expires_at` |

### Validity Schema

```yaml
validity:
  type: versioned          # evergreen | versioned | temporal
  version_bound: "react >= 18"  # For versioned type
  expires_at: "2026-12-31"      # For temporal type
```

### Confidence Lifecycle

```
New entry: confidence = 0.5 (default)
    ↓ valid feedback
Growing: 0.5 → 0.7 → 0.85
    ↓ consistent positive use
Proven: 0.9+ (after 10+ surfacings)
    ↓ invalid feedback / staleness
Declining: 0.85 → 0.6 → 0.3
    ↓ retirement threshold
Retired: confidence < 0.2
```

### Retirement Conditions

An entry is flagged for retirement when ANY of:

- `confidence < 0.2`
- Not surfaced in 180+ days AND `confidence < 0.5`
- 5+ `invalid` feedback entries
- `validity.type == "temporal"` AND `expires_at` has passed
- `validity.type == "versioned"` AND version is no longer in use

Retired entries are archived (not deleted) for historical reference.

## 8. Metrics

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Healthy Range |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Hit rate | `times_useful / times_surfaced` | > 0.6 |
| Feedback ratio | `(valid + invalid) / times_surfaced` | > 0.3 |
| Library growth | New entries per month | 5–20 |
| Retirement rate | Retired entries per month | < 20% of new |
| Coverage | Categories with 5+ entries | 6+ of 9 categories |

### Health Indicators

| Indicator | Good | Warning | Action Needed |
|-----------|------|---------|---------------|
| Avg confidence | > 0.6 | 0.4–0.6 | < 0.4 |
| Hit rate | > 0.6 | 0.3–0.6 | < 0.3 |
| Stale entries | < 10% | 10–25% | > 25% |
| Orphan entries (never surfaced) | < 15% | 15–30% | > 30% |

---

## 9. Storage Format

### Recommended: YAML per Category

```
.memory/
├── pitfall.yaml
├── pattern.yaml
├── anti-pattern.yaml
├── mental-model.yaml
├── workaround.yaml
├── performance.yaml
├── debugging-strategy.yaml
├── tool-usage.yaml
├── decision-rationale.yaml
└── _index.yaml          # ID registry and cross-references
```

#### File Size Guideline

| Entries per File | Recommendation |
|------------------|----------------|
| < 100 | Single YAML file per category |
| 100–500 | Split by sub-topic within category |
| > 500 | Consider JSONL format |

### Alternative: JSONL

For large memory stores, use one JSONL file per category:

```
.memory/
├── pitfall.jsonl
├── pattern.jsonl
└── ...
```

Each line is a complete JSON object representing one memory entry.

### Index File (`_index.yaml`)

```yaml
# Memory Index
last_id: "MEM-2026-0042"
total_entries: 42
by_category:
  pitfall: 12
  pattern: 8
  anti-pattern: 5
  mental-model: 3
  workaround: 4
  performance: 3
  debugging-strategy: 2
  tool-usage: 3
  decision-rationale: 2
```

## 10. Architecture Decision: Always-On Protocol

### Classification

Developer Persistent Memory is classified as an **Always-On Protocol**, not a User-Triggered workflow.

| Pattern | Characteristics | Examples | Skill Required? |
|---------|----------------|----------|-----------------|
| **User-Triggered** | User explicitly invokes, multi-step guided workflow | `/commit`, `/code-review`, `/sdd` | Yes |
| **Always-On Protocol** | AI continuously follows rules after loading ai.yaml | Anti-hallucination, Developer Memory | No |

### Rationale: No CLI / Skill / Slash Command Needed

| Component | Decision | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| CLI commands (`uds memory ...`) | **Not needed** | Core operations (semantic matching, insight extraction, confidence adjustment) require LLM intelligence; CLI can only do string matching |
| Skill (`skills/developer-memory/`) | **Not needed** | `developer-memory.ai.yaml` is self-sufficient with complete schema + rules + proactive protocol |
| `/memory add`, `/memory search` | **Not needed** | Contradicts the "proactive behavior" design — AI should extract and surface automatically |
| `/memory review` | **Deferred** | Only potentially useful command; defer until user feedback indicates need |

### How It Works Without Additional Tooling

```
AI loads developer-memory.ai.yaml
    ↓
Rules automatically activate:
  - proactive-surfacing: Surface relevant memories on context match
  - proactive-extraction: Detect insight moments, offer to record
  - proactive-aggregation: Suggest merging related entries
  - noise-control: Respect push levels and cooldown
    ↓
No explicit user trigger needed
```

### Future Considerations

If user feedback reveals:
- **Discoverability gap**: Consider a lightweight Skill (configuration detection + discoverability)
- **Explicit review need**: Consider `/memory review` slash command
- **Never needed**: `uds memory add/search` CLI commands — these operations inherently require LLM
