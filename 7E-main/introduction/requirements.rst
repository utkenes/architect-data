|Intro|.1  Requirements
-------------------------------

This chapter establishes the ambitious goal of building a network that
scales to a global footprint and supports a wide range of
applications.  Scalability and generality are actually just two (of
many) requirements our design must address. This section expands on
these, and other requirements.  To place the requirements in their
proper context, it is important to recognize that there are multiple
stakeholders interested in the outcome.  They include:

* **Application Developers:** People who program applications care
  about the communication services their applications need. This
  includes, for example, a guarantee that each message the application
  sends will be delivered without error within a certain amount of
  time or the ability to switch gracefully among different connections
  to the network as the user moves around.

* **Network Operators:** People who operate networks care that it is
  easy to administer and manage. This includes, for example, that
  faults can be easily isolated, new devices can be added to the
  network and configured correctly, and it is easy to account for
  usage.

* **Network Owners:** People who assemble networks for a particular
  use case, such as an enterprise or datacenter, take budgetary
  considerations into account. These stakeholders care that they get a
  good return on investment—that network resources are used
  efficiently.

It's possible to come up with other stakeholders, but this list
is inclusive enough to stress our design. Importantly, instead of
adopting just one of these as our primary perspective, we approach the
problem of building a network from the perspective of the architect
who is responsible for crafting a design that takes all stakeholder
requirements into account.

With this in mind, our first requirement is that the network be
*scalable*.  Scalability does not necessarily mean picking a target
size, but rather, being aware of factors that might limit how large a
network can grow.  The original Internet architects were aware that
using 32-bit addresses for Internet-connected devices implied there
could be no more than 2\ :sup:`32` (over 4 billion) devices.\ [#]_
That number seemed more than adequate at the time, but of course,
we now know that it wasn't (and workarounds have been engineered).

.. [#] The Internet refers to connected devices as *hosts* since they
   "host" user programs. The Mobile Cellular Network refers to
   connected devices as *User Equipment*, or *UEs*, since they belong
   to the customer and not the operator.  We use all three
   terms—devices, hosts, UEs—but most often say hosts because of the
   important role the software they run plays in the network's design.

There are other, less obvious factors that can limit network growth.
Restricting the number of stakeholders responsible for different
aspects of the network is an important one. For example, controlling
who may deploy applications tends to limit the user communities that
might benefit from the network; anyone should be able to deploy a new
application that serves some community, no matter how niche.  As
another example, it would not be practical for a limited operations
team to be responsible for fixing every outage reported anywhere on
the planet; anyone should be able to own, and then take responsibility
for operating, a piece of the global network. Avoiding these kinds of
limitations may seem obvious, but historically, many networks have
assumed tight control by a central authority rather than the loose
federation of cooperating parties, as is the case with the Internet.

The second requirement is that the network be *general-purpose*, that
is, able to support a wide range of applications. In principle, this
means avoiding assumptions about how the network will be used. In
practice, this means two things. First, the network should allow
applications to be implemented in software on general-purpose
processors. Second, the lowest levels of the network—the base that is
shared by all applications—should be close to minimal. It should
provide a service that is of value to all applications and leave most
decisions about functionality to higher layers (with the application
at the top of the software stack).  At the same time, many
applications share common requirements about such things as
reliability and security, so it is helpful to provide optional
capabilities they can employ if they want to. Getting this balance
right—creating a minimal set of base services, with optional shared
services available on top of the base—requires some judgement, which
we revisit at many points throughout the book.

The third requirement is that the network allow for *cost-effective
resource sharing*. Networks are built using finite resources; they do
not have infinite capacity and it is not generally practical to
provide dedicated connectivity between any two communicating entities.
This means networks are fundamentally a shared resource, making the
mechanism that allocates resources to different users a key technical
challenge. This mechanism should be fair (for some definition of
fairness), but also efficient. The latter requirement means that we
want to maximize the amount of data the network delivers on behalf of its
users, for a given set of resource capacities.  We expand on this
requirement in Section |Intro|.4.

The fourth requirement is that the network be *high performance.*
Everyone wants the network to be fast, but performance is
multi-faceted.  Some applications care about response time; how long
it takes to send and receive a message. Others care about throughput;
how long it takes to download a large file. Still others care that
packet delivery is predictable, so that a video stream plays without
jarring pauses. All of these metrics depend on physical limitations,
such as the speed of light, but there is also significant work that a
network has to do in order to deliver on this potential. We expand
on this requirement in Section |Intro|.5.

We highlight these four requirements because they dominate the design
challenges discussed throughout the book. There are other
requirements, all of which mirror the requirements one would place on
any computer system. They include that the network be secure,
manageable, reliable, usable, available, evolvable, and so on. All of
these requirements play a role, and we address them throughout the
book. Keep in mind, though, that it is not possible to design any
system that treats all requirements as equally "the most important".
Tradeoffs are inevitable, and priorities change over time.  Security
is a great example.  Everyone agrees security is important, but it was
of lower priority during the early days of the Internet, when the
focus was on getting it to work in the first place. As the Internet
became more successful, attracting more and more users and
applications, security moved up in importance. Today it is one of the
topmost concerns. We address security in multiple places throughout
the book, with the most detailed discussion in Chapter |TLS|. For a more
comprehensive look at network security, we recommend a companion book.
