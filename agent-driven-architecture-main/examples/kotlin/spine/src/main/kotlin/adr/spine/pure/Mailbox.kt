// ── spine/pure/mailbox — what a barge-in consumer can be told (12.1–12.3) ──
// Three kinds of message, and the parent declares `source` ONCE so every one of
// them says where it came from. That single property is doing three jobs: it is the
// key conflation counts by, the scope dedupe runs in, and the attribution an
// Interrupt or a Drain carries onto the timeline.
//
// The three policies are the three variants, not three flags on one:
//
//     Input      reason about this          — conflate or queue, per the source's policy
//     Interrupt  PREEMPT                    — cancel the running turn, JOIN it, then run
//     Drain      DEFER, then finalize       — never preempts, never cancels
//
// ZERO I/O: no channel, no coroutine, no clock. The transport is pure; the machinery
// that moves it lives in spine/concurrency (gate check C8).

 * perishable sensor feed at the same time.
 *
 * **The default is [DurableQueue]** ([policyFor] below). Three reasons, in order:
 *
 *  1. 12.2 says newest-input-wins is "exactly wrong for a durable work queue (the
 *     flagship server-agent deployment)". A default that is wrong for the flagship
 *     deployment is the wrong default.
 *  2. The failure modes are asymmetric. Durable-on-perishable processes stale items:
 *     wasteful, observable, recoverable. Perishable-on-durable SILENTLY LOSES WORK.
 *  3. It matches 14.3's posture: the safe classification is the default and the
 *     cheap one has to be declared and reviewed — exactly what `Verb` already does
