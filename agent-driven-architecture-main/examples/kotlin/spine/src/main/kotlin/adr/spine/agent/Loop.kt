// ── spine/agent/loop — the loop is a DECLARATION (G3) ──────────────────
// The ONLY file in spine/ that imports the agent-loop runtime (aisdk-kotlin). It
// does two things and nothing else:
//
//   1. it declares one SDK tool per registered Verb — the verb TABLE is the tool
//      surface, so adding a verb touches no file here (16.1);
//   2. it forwards each finished step's raw tool CALLS to the boundary as Actions.
//
// It forwards ACTIONS, NOT RESULTS. That is what makes spine/boundary/action the
// single production site of every ToolResult in the system (gate check C7), so a
// recorded result can never disagree with what the boundary folded. It also means a
// decode failure becomes a folded, committed ToolResult.Unhandled instead of a
// silently dropped step.
//
// There is no `if`, no `for`, no `while` and no `try` in this file (gate check C14).
// A loop with control flow in it is a loop with policy in it.
