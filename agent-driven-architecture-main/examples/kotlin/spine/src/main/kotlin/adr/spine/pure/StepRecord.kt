// ── spine/pure/step-record — THE unit of commit and THE unit of replay (G9) ─
// The shipped reference committed `append(signedCommands, capturedResults)` — no
// clock. A live boundary that folded at now=1001 re-folded at now=0, because the
// only thing that could have carried the timestamp was never written down.
//
// The commit is the STEP, not the pair. `now` rides the record, or a re-fold
// cannot reproduce what a live boundary wrote.
//
// Every field earns its place:
//   schemaVersion  which shape the rest of the record is in (14.7) — the envelope,
//             so a log written across deployments is self-describing
//   now       the injected clock read — without it, timestamps are lost outright
//   sig       the stamp the fold was given (who acted + under whose permission)
//   staged    the ordered off-bus input this step consumed (5.4)
//   actions   what was ASKED — differs from `results` whenever the gate refused
//   results   POST-GATE — exactly what was FOLDED
//   commands  the signed record, with the minted ids that cannot be re-derived
//   context   promptVersion + the rendered digest the model saw (G15/14.7)
//
// THE SCHEMA ENVELOPE (14.7). `schemaVersion` has NO DEFAULT: the one site that
// mints a record has to stamp it, and a historical record — [StepRecordV1] — is
// a DIFFERENT TYPE that `Replay.refold` cannot be handed at all. Upcasting is
// the only way an old log reaches the fold, which is exactly what 14.7 asks
// for: never touch history (14.1); transform on the way in.
//
// Kotlin gets the PAYLOAD half of that refusal for free, and it is worth naming
// because the other port does not: [adr.contract.TriageV1Result] does not extend
// `ToolResult`, so a v1 payload cannot be placed into `results` by hand no matter
// what the envelope says. The TypeScript port is structural and had to buy the
// same guarantee with a conflicting discriminant.
