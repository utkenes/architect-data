// ── THE REFERENCE LINT — one public citation namespace, validated ─────────
//
// The public namespace is fixed at the G-laws plus book section numbers. This
// module is the PURE half: it takes a corpus, the book's own section set and
// the registry's own law-id set, and reports four classes of citation that may
// not ship. Keeping it pure is what lets the same function judge the live tree
// AND a checked-in violating/compliant corpus, so the lint has the block/allow
// pair §15.2 demands of every other check in this repo.
//
// TWO LINTS LIVE HERE, one per coordinate of a reference. `citationProblems`
// below judges a citation's TEXT — the four classes named next. `crossRefProblems`,
// in the second half of this file, judges a LINK: its href and its visible
// label, which are two claims about the same destination and can disagree. Its
// own banner is down there.
//
// THE FOUR DENIED CLASSES OF A CITATION
//
//   1. A RETIRED REVIEW ID — a leading F, A, L or D followed by a number. 525
//      of them shipped, and they were worse than noise: the letter-D namespace
//      COLLIDED. The same spelling meant an invariant in the reference ports
//      and an entirely different, unrelated entry in the ratified decisions
//      record, so a reader who resolved a code citation against that record got
//      a wrong answer every time. They are retired by REWRITING each to its
//      public equivalent, never by deleting the sentence.
//
//   2. A SECTION THE BOOK DOES NOT HAVE — the phantom class. Eleven were live
//      across four non-existent subsections, pointing at text that has never
//      existed. A citation nobody can follow is worse than none: it reads as
//      authority and resolves to nothing. A head outside the book's own range
//      is REPORTED, not silently dropped.
//
//   3. A G-ID OUTSIDE THE REGISTRY. The law-id set is DERIVED from laws.toml,
//      never a hard-coded range, because the two ids anyone is likeliest to
//      write are exactly the two the ratified record refused to mint.
//
//   4. A CHECK ID CITED AS BOOK AUTHORITY. C1–C15 are check-roster internals.
//      Scoped to wiki/ only: the reference ports legitimately carry them in
//      rosters, fixture paths and comments, and the whole swept wiki/ tree
//      measured ZERO, so the rule has no false positives to trade against.
//
// WHERE A BARE `N.N` IS READ, AND WHY NOT EVERYWHERE
//
//   · STRICT — a comment line of a comment-bearing source file: every bare
//     `N.N` must resolve. `// see 99.9 for the rule` is a phantom and is
//     reported as one.
//   · LOOSE — any other line of a source file, and any line of a data file
//     (.json, .toml): a bare `N.N` is read only when it has exactly two
//     components and a head inside the book's 1..18 range. Dependency versions
//     are three-component (`2.4.0`, `1.11.0`, `6.0.208`) and fall outside;
//     measured across the whole tree, this narrowing costs ZERO real citations
//     and admits ZERO version strings. The bound moves WITH the book: the
//     appendix made 18 a real head, and the widening was measured before it
//     landed — no two-component `18.N` exists anywhere in the scanned corpus,
//     so it admits no version string either.
//   · PROSE (.md, .html) — a bare `N.N` is NOT read. Widening it here drowns:
//     `node >=14.17` and `Apache-2.0` are indistinguishable from citations.
//     The sweep therefore writes `§N.N` in prose, and the §-marked form IS read
//     in every file type. This is the one deliberate narrowing in the module
//     and its two arrays are asserted as literals by citations.test.ts.

// ── THE CROSS-REFERENCE LINT — a reference has TWO coordinates ─────────────
//
// `citationProblems` above judges a citation's TEXT. A cross-reference in the
// book is not text: it is `<a class="x" href="#anchor">label</a>`, and it makes
// TWO claims at once — the href says where the reader lands, the visible label
// says which section that is. Nothing in this tree read either one. The href was
// guarded by a two-way grep a human ran by hand; the label was guarded by
// nothing at all, and could not be: the PROSE narrowing above deliberately
// refuses to read a bare `N.N` in an `.html` file. MEASURED on this book, 191
// unlinked bare `N.N` sit outside anchors and none of them is a citation — 35
// in the inline stylesheet, the rest `stroke-width:1.5px` in embedded diagram
// source, figure numbers, and a swap-door range. So a label could name a section
// the book does not have, or a different section from the one it links to, and
// both gates stayed green over it.
//
// The POSITION is what makes this readable where free prose is not. Inside
// `<a … href="…">…</a>` a bare number is machine-identifiable as a claim about a
// section; two lines earlier in a stylesheet it is a stroke width. This module
// keys on the STRUCTURAL POSITION and never on the spelling, which is exactly
// the narrowing above, applied rather than undone. `<span class="n">` is read on
// the same grounds: it is the book's own dedicated section-number element inside
// a table-of-contents link, as machine-identifiable as `<span class="num">`.
//
// THE LABEL NAMESPACE IS D30'S. Four label FORMS carry a claim a machine may
// adjudicate — a nav number, a bare section number (with or without the `§` the
// sweep mandates in prose), the `section NN` word form, and a G-id. All four
// name D30's one public namespace: book section numbers plus G-ids. They are not
// a namespace of their own and they are not exhaustive of how that namespace is
// spelled — `citationProblems` above reads the same namespace in every other
// file type, and `§N.N` is the spelling it mandates there.
//
// FIVE DENIED CLASSES
//
//   1. DANGLING — an href whose target page is not in the corpus, or whose
//      fragment is not an `id=` in that page. In-page (`#x`) and cross-file
//      (`index.html#x`, `../index.html`) alike, so the worked example's links up
//      into the book are read on the same footing as the book's own.
//   2. PHANTOM LABEL — a number-form label that is not a section the page it
//      LANDS IN declares. The href may resolve perfectly; the visible text still
//      names a section nobody can find. Scoped per page rather than to one
//      union, because the worked example numbers its own sections 00–06 and
//      those are not the book's.
//   3. NUMBERED DISAGREEMENT — the label's head is not the section number of the
//      id it points at. The id→number map credits an IN-SECTION anchor
//      (`the-dependency-rule`, a note inside §7) to its enclosing section, or
//      three legitimate links would read as defects. A target with NO section
//      number at all is a disagreement too, not an exemption: the label names a
//      book section and the destination is not one.
//   4. WORDED DISAGREEMENT — the same claim spelled `section NN` / `sections
//      NN`. Its own class because its own hits are the ones that were live.
//   5. LAW-LABEL TARGET — a G-id label must land where that law is WRITTEN DOWN,
//      which is a definition and not a mention. Every G-id is discussed in at
//      least two sections of this book, so "the destination's text carries the
//      id" is a sieve: measured, all 49 live law labels could be repointed at a
//      wrong section and stay green under it. The rule reads the DEFINITION
//      CELL instead — a table cell whose entire content is the id — which is a
//      SHAPE derived from the markup, never a hard-coded section number.
//
// THE ONE EXEMPTION, DECLARED: a WHOLE-FILE href (`example/seam.html`, `../
// index.html`) makes no claim about a section, so its label is counted and never
// adjudicated. This is load-bearing rather than cautious: the seven seam pages
// head their parts `▸`, `A`…`E`, which are not digits, so their token sets are
// EMPTY, and the worked example's own nav runs 00–07 over a page numbered 00–06.
// Routing whole-file nav links through the phantom rule manufactures sixty-plus
// false positives against markup that is correct.
//
// AN ABSOLUTE OR PROTOCOL-RELATIVE HREF IS NOT A REPO PATH. `https://…`,
// `mailto:…` and `//host/x` name no corpus page; splicing them through the
// relative-path resolver produces a nonsense path and reports a link that is
// fine as dangling, with no pin to update and no suppression available. They are
// counted in their own bucket and exempted from all five denials. Their LABELS
// still count in the census, so converting internal links into absolute ones
// wholesale is still a visible diff. QUERY STRINGS, stated rather than left
// silent: anything from `?` up to the `#` is stripped before resolving. Zero
// exist today, so either answer was free — the silence is what was forbidden.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT READ: a prose label. `Fig 7.1`, `the dependency
// rule`, `G1–G16`, `§ mapping` and `seam 07` are English, and an instrument that
// guessed at their intent would be the nuisance 15.2 warns about. They are
// counted, and the count is pinned, so a wholesale conversion of adjudicable
// labels into prose is a red diff rather than a quiet exemption.
