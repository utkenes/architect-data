/**
 * `uds deps` — does what you test match what your ranges resolve to?
 * // implements XSPEC-366 R1
 *
 * Compares, per runtime dependency, the declared range, the version the
 * lockfile pins, and the version a fresh install would resolve that range to.
 *
 * It deliberately stops there. Whether a gap between the second and third
 * numbers is already in a user's hands depends on how the project ships —
 * a published npm package carries no lockfile, so consumers resolve the
 * ranges themselves; an artifact that ships its lockfile (a container image,
 * a deployed service) hands users the pinned column and meets the third one
 * at its next lockfile regeneration. This module cannot know which applies,
 * so it never phrases the gap as something users already have.
 *
 * See `utils/dependency-resolution.js` for why resolution goes through
 * `npm view` and why a failed lookup is never reported as agreement.
