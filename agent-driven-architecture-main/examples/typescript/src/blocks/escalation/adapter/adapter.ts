// ── blocks/escalation/adapter/adapter — THIS BLOCK'S IMPURE UNIT (G13) ────
// Anything holding a client, a DB handle or a socket lives here — one clearly
// named place per block, never inline in a tool. The DB call ships INSIDE the
// block as port+adapter (4.6/G11); `app/wire` is the only file that decides
// which adapter is real.
//
// The "client" below is a console pager, because this reference runs offline.
// In a real deployment it is a PagerDuty SDK, and nothing else about the block
// changes.
