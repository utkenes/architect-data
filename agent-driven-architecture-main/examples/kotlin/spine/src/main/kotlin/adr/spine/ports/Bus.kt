// ── spine/ports/bus — the append-only timeline (G9/14.1) ───────────────────
// append() takes a whole StepRecord and returns the offset it landed at. The
// returned StepIndex is the ORIGIN of every effect key in that step, which is what
// makes "commit strictly precedes perform" a fact about the code rather than a
// convention about the order two lines happen to be written in.
