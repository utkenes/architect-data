// ── app/wire — THE SINGLE COMPOSITION ROOT (G7) ────────────────────────
// Exactly one file may know what is real and what is faked in a build. Removing it
// means a service locator, which G7 forbids.
//
// Everything that binds is here: every port→adapter binding, the effect dispatcher,
// the Boundary, the Controller, and the agent loop. Plugging a block in is its
// `register(...)` line plus its port binding plus its `performer(...)` line; pulling
// it out is the same list, subtracted, plus `rm -rf blocks/<X>/`.
//
// A NEW EFFECT KIND appended to a block's EXISTING effect union is not on that
// list any more. It costs its case in the owning block's contract and its arm in
// that block's own performer — both inside the folder — and nothing here. A block
// growing its FIRST effect kind is the one exception: one compiler-named line in
// this file's performer assembly, the "handful of appends, every one
// compiler-named" headline the decisions record ratifies for the blast-radius
// table (docs/DECISIONS.md:125). This file names exactly one effect kind,
// `Effect.Diag`, which is the spine's own and stays the root's to perform.
//
// RECEIPT, 2026-07-30 — CLOSED 2026-08-01. Addressed to the blast-radius table the
// decisions record schedules for the book (theme 5). When this file landed, three prose
// sites still stated something it had made false, and rewriting them belonged to that
// later entry rather than to this one; the ADR pre-authorised the deletion and gated it
// on being accepted, and it was ratified 2026-07-26, so only the phase order was
// holding it.
//
// That entry has landed, and ADR-001 §1.3 Q1 now records the deletion as performed.
// TWO CORRECTIONS to what this receipt originally claimed, both measured rather than
// argued. The set was FIVE prose sites, not three: the two it missed were the worked
// example's own blast-radius table row and the TypeScript port's README. And all five
// are rewritten, so nothing is outstanding here.
//
// THE MEASURED REPLACEMENT, stated as the set the real compiler names rather than as a
// bare zero. Appending a novel kind to an existing block's effect union costs, in this
// port: `blocks/<owner>/Contract.kt` (the case) and `blocks/<owner>/Register.kt` (the
// performer arm, compiler-named) — both inside the folder — plus
// `src/test/kotlin/adr/app/TotalityTest.kt`, the GATE's own totality ledger
// (`EffectSamples`), which is out of folder and maintained per effect case exactly as
// the TS port's verb ledger already is. So, for kinds on an existing union (a FIRST
// kind adds one performer-assembly line here): out-of-folder PRODUCTION sites (anything
// under `src/main/`) = 0, in BOTH ports, earned by the real compiler — not 0 sites
// overall. The pins that keep that honest are `gateEffectKindBlockTest` plus the
// live-tree and TEST-tree censuses in `adr.gate.GateTest`, which assert the
// out-of-folder set as an equality rather than as an absence.
