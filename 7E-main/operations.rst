Chapter |Ops|:  Operating Networks
========================================

The focus of this book has been on the challenge of designing and
building a network, but the day you succeed in getting your network up
and running, you will discover that someone then needs to operate it.
And if you've done a good job in the design phase, that ops team will
be rewarded by getting to operate it for a long time, spanning
generations of hardware and software technologies.  For their sake,
your design should take the network's operational requirements into
account. This chapter looks at those requirements, and describes
mechanisms commonly built into networks to address them.

One of the biggest challenges in understanding network operations is
making sense of the breadth of practices that have been invented to
manage networks. This includes both terminology and tools. Telcos—some
of the earliest organizations to operate data networks—have nearly a
century of know-how in operating networks, with many of those
practices adapted from earlier voice networks.  Today's cloud
providers operate both massive datacenter networks that connect tens
of thousands of servers, and global backbone networks that
interconnect hundreds of datacenters. Their focus on feature
velocity—which takes advantage of agile software practices and
commodity hardware—has led to an entirely different approach for
operations. Yet another class of operator is the system administrator
responsible for buying, configuring, and maintaining hardware that
serves an enterprise or department. Their approach to operations is
heavily influenced by the vendors that sell them servers, routers, and
other network appliances. And finally there is you, either managing
your home network, or, like many people, outsourcing that
responsibility to their ISP.

In this chapter, we avoid the use of arcane terminology, and focus
instead on the fundamental issues all of these operators face. They
all have the same goals: to ensure the network has enough features and
capacity to handle the demands of its current workload, and then
deploy additional resources and functionality when needed; to decide
how all the hardware and software components they deploy should be
configured, and then set their parameters accordingly; and to detect
when something goes wrong, troubleshoot the cause of that failure, and
then take corrective action.
