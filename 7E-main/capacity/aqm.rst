|Capacity|.3  Active Queue Management
-------------------------------------------

We now look at the role routers can play in congestion control, an
approach often referred to as *Active Queue Management* (AQM).
Changing router behavior has never been the Internet’s preferred way
of introducing new features, but nonetheless, the approach has been a
constant source of consternation over the last 30 years. The problem
is that while it’s generally agreed that routers are in an ideal
position to detect the onset of congestion—it's their queues that
start to fill up—there has not been a consensus on exactly what the
best algorithm is. The following describes two mechanisms, and
concludes with a brief discussion of where things stand today.

|Capacity|.3.1 Random Early Detection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first mechanism, called *random early detection* (RED), involves
programming each router to monitor local queue lengths, and when it
detects that congestion is imminent, to notify the source of that
fact.  RED was invented by Sally Floyd and Van Jacobson in the early
1990s. It was inspired by a similar mechanism invented by
K.K. Ramakrishnan and Raj Jain, which ran on the Digital Network
Architecture (an early peer of the TCP/IP Internet).

As originally designed, RED did not explicitly send a congestion
notification message to the source, but instead *implicitly* notified
the source of congestion by dropping one of its packets. The source
effectively learns about the dropped packet when a subsequent timeout
happens.\ [#]_ As the “early” part of the RED acronym suggests, the router
drops the packet earlier than it would have to—before it is completely
out of buffer space—so as to notify the
source that it should decrease its sending rate before tail drop sets
in. By dropping a few packets before
it has exhausted its buffer space completely, the router causes the
source(s) to slow down, with the hope that this will mean it does not
have to drop lots of packets later on.

.. [#] Timeouts are a mechanism commonly used by transport protocols
       to determine that a packet has not been successfully delivered.
       Every time a sender transmits a packet it sets a timer, and
       should the timer expire before an acknowledgment is received,
       it assumes the packet was dropped. Timeouts are used to
       implement reliable delivery (as described in Chapter 12) and as
       a signal that the network is congested (as described in Chapter
       13).

The main contribution of RED is how it decides when to drop a packet
and what packet it decides to drop. To understand the basic idea,
consider a simple FIFO queue. Rather than wait for the queue to become
completely full and then be forced to drop each arriving packet (the
tail drop policy described in the previous section), we could decide
to drop each arriving packet with some *drop probability* whenever the
queue length exceeds some *drop level*. This idea is called *early
random drop*. The RED algorithm defines the details of how to monitor
the queue length and when to drop a packet.

In the following paragraphs, we describe the RED algorithm as
originally proposed by Floyd and Jacobson. We note that several
modifications have since been proposed both by the inventors and by
other researchers.  However, the key ideas are the same as those
presented below, and most current implementations are close to the
algorithm that follows.

First, RED computes an average queue length using a weighted running
average.  That is, ``AvgLen`` is computed as

.. math:: \mathsf{AvgLen = (1 - Weight)\ x\ AvgLen + Weight\ x\ SampleLen}

where 0 < ``Weight`` < 1 and ``SampleLen`` is the length of the queue
when a sample measurement is made. In most software implementations,
the queue length is measured every time a new packet arrives at the
router.  In hardware, it might be calculated at some fixed sampling
interval.

The reason for using an average queue length rather than an
instantaneous one is that it more accurately captures the notion of
congestion. Because of the bursty nature of Internet traffic, queues
can become full very quickly and then become empty again. If a queue
is spending most of its time empty, then it’s probably not appropriate
to conclude that the router is congested and to tell the hosts to slow
down. Thus, the weighted running average calculation tries to detect
long-lived congestion, as indicated in the right-hand portion of
:numref:`Figure %s <fig-red-avg>`, by filtering out short-term changes
in the queue length. You can think of the running average as a
low-pass filter, where ``Weight`` determines the time constant of the
filter. The question of how we pick this time constant is discussed
below.

.. _fig-red-avg:
.. figure:: capacity/figures/f06-15.png
   :width: 500px
   :align: center

   Weighted running average queue length.

Second, RED has two queue length thresholds that trigger certain
activity: ``MinThreshold`` and ``MaxThreshold``. When a packet arrives
at the gateway, RED compares the current ``AvgLen`` with these two
thresholds, according to the following rules:

.. code-block::

  if AvgLen <= MinThreshold
      queue the packet
  if MinThreshold < AvgLen < MaxThreshold
      calculate probability P
      drop the arriving packet with probability P
  if MaxThreshold <= AvgLen
      drop the arriving packet

If the average queue length is smaller than the lower threshold, no
action is taken, and if the average queue length is larger than the
upper threshold, then the packet is always dropped. If the average
queue length is between the two thresholds, then the newly arriving
packet is dropped with some probability ``P``. This situation is
depicted in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-red>`. The approximate
relationship between ``P`` and ``AvgLen`` is shown in :numref:`Figure
%s <fig-red-prob>`. Note that the probability of drop increases slowly
when ``AvgLen`` is between the two thresholds, reaching ``MaxP`` at
the upper threshold, at which point it jumps to unity. The rationale
behind this is that, if ``AvgLen`` reaches the upper threshold, then
the gentle approach (dropping a few packets) is not working and
drastic measures are called for: dropping all arriving packets. Some
research has suggested that a smoother transition from random dropping
to complete dropping, rather than the discontinuous approach shown
here, may be appropriate.

.. _fig-red-prob:

   :width: 400px
   :align: center

   Drop probability function for RED.

Although :numref:`Figure %s <fig-red-prob>` shows the probability of
drop as a function only of ``AvgLen``, the situation is actually a
little more complicated. In fact, ``P`` is a function of both
``AvgLen`` and how long it has been since the last packet was
dropped. Specifically, it is computed as follows:

.. math:: \mathsf{TempP = MaxP\ x\ (AvgLen - MinThreshold)\ /\ (MaxThreshold - MinThreshold)}

.. math:: \mathsf{P = TempP\ /\ (1 - count\ x\ TempP)}

``TempP`` is the variable that is plotted on the y-axis in
:numref:`Figure %s <fig-red-prob>`, ``count`` keeps track of how many
newly arriving packets have been queued (not dropped), and ``AvgLen``
has been between the two thresholds. ``P`` increases slowly as
``count`` increases, thereby making a drop increasingly likely as the
time since the last drop increases. This makes closely spaced drops
relatively less likely than widely spaced drops. This extra step in
calculating ``P`` was introduced by the inventors of RED when they
observed that, without it, the packet drops were not well distributed
in time but instead tended to occur in clusters. Because packet
arrivals from a certain connection are likely to arrive in bursts,
this clustering of drops is likely to cause multiple drops in a single
connection. This is not desirable, since only one drop per round-trip
time is enough to cause a connection to reduce its window size,
whereas multiple drops might cause it to slow down too much.

As an example, suppose that we set ``MaxP`` to 0.02 and ``count`` is
initialized to zero. If the average queue length were halfway between
the two thresholds, then ``TempP``, and the initial value of ``P``,
would be half of ``MaxP``, or 0.01. An arriving packet, of course, has a
99 in 100 chance of getting into the queue at this point. With each
successive packet that is not dropped, ``P`` slowly increases, and by
the time 50 packets have arrived without a drop, ``P`` would have
doubled to 0.02. In the unlikely event that 99 packets arrived without
loss, ``P`` reaches 1, guaranteeing that the next packet is dropped. The
important thing about this part of the algorithm is that it ensures a
roughly even distribution of drops over time.

The intent is that, if RED drops a small percentage of packets when
``AvgLen`` exceeds ``MinThreshold``, this will cause a few sources to
reduce their sending rate, which in turn will reduce the rate at which
packets arrive at the router. All going well, ``AvgLen`` will then
decrease and congestion is avoided. The queue length can be kept
short, while throughput remains high since few packets are dropped.

Note that, because RED is operating on a queue length averaged over
time, it is possible for the instantaneous queue length to be much
longer than ``AvgLen``. In this case, if a packet arrives and there is
nowhere to put it, then it will have to be dropped. When this happens,
RED is operating in tail drop mode. One of the goals of RED is to
prevent tail drop behavior if possible.

The random nature of RED confers an interesting property on the
algorithm. Because RED drops packets randomly, the probability that RED
decides to drop a particular flow’s packet(s) is roughly proportional to
the share of the bandwidth that flow is currently getting at that
router. This is because a flow that is sending a relatively large number
of packets is providing more candidates for random dropping. Thus, there
is some sense of fair resource allocation built into RED, although it is
by no means precise.

A fair amount of analysis has gone into setting the various RED
parameters—for example, ``MaxThreshold``, ``MinThreshold``, ``MaxP``
and ``Weight``—all in the name of optimizing the power function
(throughput-to-delay ratio). The performance of these parameters has
also been confirmed through simulation, and the algorithm has been
shown not to be overly sensitive to them. It is important to keep in
mind, however, that all of this analysis and simulation hinges on a
particular characterization of the network workload. The real
contribution of RED is a mechanism by which the router can more
accurately manage its queue length. Defining precisely what
constitutes an optimal queue length depends on the traffic mix and is
a subject of ongoing study.

Consider the setting of the two thresholds, ``MinThreshold`` and
``MaxThreshold``. If the traffic is fairly bursty, then
``MinThreshold`` should be sufficiently large to allow the link
utilization to be maintained at an acceptably high level. Also, the
difference between the two thresholds should be larger than the
typical increase in the calculated average queue length in one
RTT. Setting ``MaxThreshold`` to twice ``MinThreshold`` was deemed to
be a reasonable rule of thumb.  In addition, since we expect the
average queue length to hover between the two thresholds during
periods of high load, there should be enough free buffer space *above*
``MaxThreshold`` to absorb the natural bursts that occur in Internet
traffic without forcing the router to enter tail drop mode.

We noted above that ``Weight`` determines the time constant for the
running average low-pass filter, and this gives us a clue as to how we
might pick a suitable value for it. Recall that RED is trying to send
signals to end-to-end flows by dropping packets during times of
congestion. From the time the router drops a packet until the time
when the same router starts to see some relief from the affected
connection in terms of a reduced send rate, at least one round-trip
time must elapse for that connection. There is probably not much point
in having the router respond to congestion on time scales much less
than the round-trip time of the connections passing through it. As
noted previously, 100 ms is not a bad estimate of average round-trip
times in the Internet. Thus, ``Weight`` should be chosen such that
changes in queue length over time scales much less than 100 ms are
filtered out. Of course this only applied to the larger Internet. When
RED is applied to a datacenter network, for example, we can expect
much shorter RTTs. We revisit this issue in Section |Capacity|.4.

Since RED works by sending signals to end-to-end flows to tell them to
slow down, you might wonder what would happen if those signals are
ignored.  This is often called the *unresponsive flow* problem.
Unresponsive flows use more than their fair share of network resources
and could cause congestive collapse if there were enough of them.
Other queuing techniques, such as weighted fair queuing, could help
with this problem by isolating certain classes of traffic from
others. There was also discussion of creating a variant of RED that
could drop more heavily from flows that are unresponsive to the
initial hints that it sends. However this turns out to be challenging
because it can be hard to distinguish between non-responsive behavior
and \"correct\" behavior, especially when flows have a wide variety of
different RTTs and bottleneck bandwidths.

As a footnote, 15 prominent network researchers urged for the
widespread adoption of RED-inspired AQM in 1998. The recommendation
was largely ignored, primarily having to do with how difficult it is
to correctly set the parameters (as documented in RFC 7567). AQM
approaches based on RED have, however, been applied with some success
in datacenters.

|Capacity|.3.2 Controlled Delay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One challenge that limits RED's deployment is that it is difficult to
configure. Note the large number of parameters that affect its
operation (``MinThreshold``, ``MaxThreshold``, and ``Weight``). There
is enough research showing that RED produces a wide range of outcomes
(not all of them helpful) depending on the type of traffic and
parameter settings.  This created uncertainty around the merits of
deploying it.

Over a period of years, Van Jacobson (well known for his work on TCP
Congestion and a co-author of the original RED paper) collaborated
with Kathy Nichols and eventually other researchers to come up with an
AQM approach that improves upon RED. This work became known as CoDel
(pronounced *coddle*) for Controlled Delay AQM. CoDel builds on several
key insights that emerged over decades of experience with TCP and
AQM.

.. _reading_codel:
.. admonition:: Further Reading

   K. Nichols and V. Jacobson.
   `Controlling Queue Delay
   <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2209249.2209264>`__.
   Communications of the ACM, July 2012.

First, the CoDel authors were the ones that articulated the difference
between \"good queues\" and \"bad queues\" as illustrated in
:numref:`Figure %s <fig-good-bad>`. In a sense, then, the challenge
for an AQM algorithm is to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\"
queues, and to trigger packet loss only when the queue is determined
to be \"bad\". Indeed, this is what RED is trying to do with its
``Weight`` parameter (which filters out transient queue length).

One of the innovations of CoDel is to focus on *sojourn time*, the
time that any given packet waits in the queue.  Sojourn time is
independent of the bandwidth of a link and provides useful indication
of congestion even on links whose bandwidth varies over time, such as
wireless links. A queue that is behaving well will frequently drain to
zero, and thus, some packets will experience a sojourn time close to
zero, as in :numref:`Figure %s <fig-good-bad>` (a). Conversely, a
congested queue will delay every packet, and the minimum sojourn time
will never be close to zero, as seen in :numref:`Figure %s
<fig-good-bad>` (b). CoDel therefore measures the sojourn
time—something that is easy to do for every packet—and tracks whether
it is consistently sitting above some small target. \"Consistently\"
is defined as \"lasting longer than a typical RTT\".

Rather than asking operators to determine the parameters to make
CoDel work well, the algorithm chooses reasonable defaults. A target
sojourn time of 5ms is used, along with a sliding measurement window
of 100ms. The intuition, as with RED, is that 100ms is a typical RTT
for traffic traversing the Internet, and that if congestion is lasting
longer than 100ms, we may be moving into the \"bad queue\" region. So
CoDel monitors the sojourn time relative to the target of 5ms. If it
is above target for more than 100ms, it is time to start taking action
to reduce the queue via drops (or marking if explicit congestion
notification, described below, is available). 5ms is chosen as being
close to zero (for better delay) but not so small that the queue would
run empty. It should be noted that a great deal of experimentation and
simulation has gone into these numerical choices, but more importantly, the
algorithm does not seem to be overly sensitive to them.

To summarize, CoDel largely ignores queues that last less than an RTT,
but starts taking action as soon as a queue persists for more than an
RTT. By making reasonable assumptions about Internet RTTs, the
algorithm requires no configuration parameters.

An additional subtlety is that CoDel drops a slowly increasing
percentage of traffic as long as the observed sojourn time remains
above the target. As long as the sojourn time stays above the target,
CoDel steadily increases its drop rate in proportion to the square
root of the number of drops since the target was exceeded. The effect
of this, in theory, is to trigger enough reduction in arriving traffic
to allow the queue to drain, bringing the sojourn time back below the
target.

.. figure:: capacity/figures/codel.png
   :width: 500px
   :align: center

   Home routers can suffer from bufferbloat, a situation CoDel is
   well-suited to address.

There are more details to CoDel presented in the Nichols and Jacobson
paper, including extensive simulations to indicate its effectiveness
across a wide range of scenarios. The algorithm was originally
standardized as \"experimental\" by the IETF in RFC 8289, with a
companion specification (RFC 8290) adding fair queuing to the base
algorithm. The latter, commonly known as ``fq_codel``, assigns
distinct flows to separate queues, with the CoDel algorithm applied to
each queue independently. The ``fq_codel`` variant is the default
queuing discipline implemented in the Linux kernel. This is important
because home routers (which are often Linux-based) are a point along
the end-to-end path (see :numref:`Figure %s <fig-codel>`) that
commonly experience bufferbloat.

|Capacity|.3.3 Explicit Congestion Notification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the original AQM mechanisms designed for the Internet implicitly
notified sources about congestion by silently dropping their packets,
it has long been recognized that transport protocols such as TCP could
do a better job if routers were to send a more explicit congestion
signal. That is, instead of *dropping* a packet and assuming TCP will
eventually notice, any AQM algorithm can potentially do a better job
if it instead *marks* the packet and continues to send it along its
way to the destination. This idea was codified in changes to the IP
headers known as *Explicit Congestion Notification* (ECN), as
specified in RFC 3168.

.. _reading_ecn:
.. admonition::  Further Reading

   K. Ramakrishnan, S. Floyd, and D. Black.
   `The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP
   <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3168>`__.
   RFC 3168, September 2001.

Specifically, this feedback is implemented by using the two "unused"
bits in the IP ``TOS`` field as ECN bits. One bit is set by the source
to indicate that it is ECN-capable, that is, able to react to a
congestion notification. This is called the ``ECT`` bit (ECN-Capable
Transport).  The other bit is set by routers along the end-to-end path
when congestion is encountered, as computed by whatever AQM algorithm
it is running. This is called the ``CE`` bit (Congestion Encountered).

In addition to these two bits in the IP header (which are
transport-agnostic), ECN also includes the addition of two optional
flags to the TCP header. The first, ``ECE`` (ECN-Echo), communicates
from the receiver to the sender that it has received a packet with the
``CE`` bit set. The second, ``CWR`` (Congestion Window Reduced)
communicates from the sender to the receiver that it has reduced the
congestion window. The exact meaning of "congestion window reduced"
will be clear when we get to TCP in Chapter |TCP|, but for now you can
think of this bit as indicating that the source is slowing its sending
rate in response to a congestion notification.

While ECN is now the standard interpretation of two of the eight bits
in the ``TOS`` field of the IP header and support for ECN is highly
recommended, it is not required. Moreover, there is no single
recommended AQM algorithm, but instead, there is a list of
requirements a good AQM algorithm should meet. As is the case with
congestion control algorithms, every AQM algorithm has its advantages
and disadvantages, and so we need a lot of them to argue about.
