// ── spine/pure/spine-slice — the spine's own slice of State ─────────────────
// Two fields with two different scopes, and keeping them apart is the whole of
// 12.4's structural fix:
//
//   run      SESSION-GLOBAL. Only the boundary writes it.
//   notices  PER-ITEM. Every arm writes here when it refuses a transition.
//
// The spine also owns the two arms that are identical in every application:
// Unhandled and Refused. Both fold a diagnostic and a notice — and NO domain
// transition and NO irreversible effect.

/**
 * The floor under block dispatch: a result no block claimed (§6.5).
 *
 * `foldOk`'s ownership chain is type predicates, and TypeScript TRUSTS a
 * predicate it cannot verify — so a block whose `owns` has gone stale narrows
 * the result to `never` at compile time while a real value flows through at
 * runtime. Returning that `never` returned `undefined`, and the caller died on
 * `out.effects is not iterable`: a crash out of the one arm 6.5 says must never
 * crash.
 *
 * This is that arm, obeying 6.5 like every other — total AND observable. It
 * folds no transition, emits a diagnostic, and leaves a per-item notice naming
 * the tool, exactly as an unknown tool name does. The fold does not mint a
 * ToolResult to get here (C7 forbids that, correctly); it asks the spine.
