// ── blocks/triage/register — THE ONE PUBLIC SYMBOL (G11) ───────────────
// Everything the composition root needs from this block, bundled. Plug the block in
// by constructing it at app/wire; pull it out by deleting this folder and that line.
// Nothing outside the block reaches a triage ROLE except through this type.
//
// It is a CLASS, not an `object`. That is the whole point of this file: a loose
// `object` delegating to top-level functions hosts the same disease twice — nothing
// constructs either half, so neither can be stood up, faked or swapped, and both could
// only ever be tested through whatever called them. `TriageBlock()` is an
// instantiation, so every role below can now be exercised on its own.
//
// The constructor is EMPTY, and that is the honest result of the split rule rather
// than an oversight: `arm`, `view` and `contextLines` share no argument that is fixed
// across calls, so there is nothing to hoist. The one genuinely fixed argument in the
// block — the lens a registration is built against — belongs to blocks/triage/tools,
// and `register` hands it there.
//
// The block is generic in the app's State: it is handed a LENS onto its own slice,
// so it never has to know what else is in State (G11).
