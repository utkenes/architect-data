// ── spine/pure/turn — how a turn ENDS, and what the consumer must not swallow ─
// 12.4: a turn that throws degrades to a TYPED STATUS carrying its cause, and the
// consumer lives. The exception never crosses the loop, because the loop is the
// heartbeat and a heartbeat that dies on a bad message is not a heartbeat.
//
// ConsumerEvent is the other half of the same rule: a busy-drop, a duplicate, a
// fault and a blown cancel deadline are all DECISIONS, so none of them may be
// silent (12.2). They are reported out of the consumer as spine-shaped events; the
// composition root maps them to app Actions, and they then travel the ONE existing
// path — resolveAction → gate → fold → commit → signed Command. That is why
// observability here costs the core zero new machinery.
//
// ZERO I/O (gate check C8).
