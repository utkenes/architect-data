## Overview

This document defines supply chain security standards covering Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), dependency auditing, SLSA maturity levels, license compliance, and dependency health assessment.

---

## Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

### SBOM Formats Comparison

| Aspect | SPDX | CycloneDX |
|--------|------|-----------|
| **Maintainer** | Linux Foundation | OWASP |
| **Primary Focus** | License compliance + security | Security + component analysis |
| **Format** | JSON, RDF, YAML, Tag-Value | JSON, XML, Protobuf |
| **ISO Standard** | ISO/IEC 5962:2021 | ECMA-424 |
| **Ecosystem** | Strong in open source governance | Strong in DevSecOps tooling |

### Selection Guide

- **Choose SPDX** when license compliance is the primary concern or ISO certification is required
- **Choose CycloneDX** when security analysis and DevSecOps integration are priorities
- **Either format** is acceptable; consistency within an organization is more important than the choice

### SBOM Requirements

- Every release MUST include an SBOM listing all direct and transitive dependencies
- SBOM MUST include: component name, version, supplier, license, and known vulnerabilities
- SBOM SHOULD be generated automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline

---

## Dependency Audit

### Four Audit Dimensions

| Dimension | What to Check | Severity |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Known Vulnerabilities** | CVE database (NVD, OSV, GitHub Advisory) | Critical: block, High: warn |
| **License Compliance** | License compatibility with project license | Incompatible: block |
| **Maintenance Status** | Last commit date, open issues, maintainer count | Unmaintained > 2 years: warn |
| **Version Currency** | How many major/minor versions behind latest | Major behind > 2: warn |

### Audit Frequency

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Every CI build | Vulnerability scan (automated) |
| Weekly | Full audit report (automated) |
| Before release | Manual review of all warnings |
| On security advisory | Immediate assessment of affected deps |

---

## SLSA Levels

Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts define maturity levels for build integrity:

| Level | Requirements | Applicable Scenario |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **L1 — Provenance** | Build process documented; SBOM generated | All projects (minimum baseline) |
| **L2 — Build Service** | Build on hosted service; signed provenance | Projects with CI/CD pipelines |
| **L3 — Hardened Builds** | Isolated, ephemeral build environments; non-falsifiable provenance | Security-critical applications |
| **L4 — Two-Party Review** | Two-person review for all changes; hermetic builds | Infrastructure, financial systems |

### Progression Path

Start at L1, progressively adopt higher levels based on risk profile:

```
L1 (All projects) → L2 (CI/CD projects) → L3 (Security-critical) → L4 (High-assurance)
```

---

## License Compliance

### License Category Matrix

| Category | Examples | Compatibility | Risk |
|----------|---------|--------------|------|
| **Permissive** | MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2/3 | Compatible with almost everything | Low |
| **Weak Copyleft** | LGPL-2.1, MPL-2.0 | Compatible if used as library (not modified) | Medium |
| **Strong Copyleft** | GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0 | Requires derivative works to use same license | High |
| **Network Copyleft** | AGPL-3.0 | Extends copyleft to network interaction | Very High |
| **Proprietary** | Custom, No License | Cannot use without explicit permission | Block |

### Compliance Rules

- **Permissive + Permissive**: Always compatible
- **Permissive + Copyleft**: Compatible if copyleft terms are followed
- **Copyleft + Different Copyleft**: Often incompatible — legal review required
- **AGPL in SaaS**: Triggers copyleft for the entire service — requires careful evaluation
- **No License**: Treat as proprietary — do not use without explicit permission

## Dependency Update Strategy

| Update Type | Strategy | Automation |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Patch** (x.y.Z) | Auto-merge after CI passes | Fully automated (Dependabot/Renovate) |
| **Minor** (x.Y.0) | Auto-create PR, manual review | Semi-automated |
| **Major** (X.0.0) | Manual evaluation, migration plan | Manual with changelog review |
| **Lock Strategy** | Commit lock files — **and, if you publish, separately verify what consumers resolve to** (see below) | Lock file committed; consumer resolution checked at release |

### Update Rules

- Lock files MUST be committed to version control
- Patch updates SHOULD be applied within 7 days
- Security patches MUST be applied within 48 hours (Critical) or 7 days (High)
- Major version upgrades SHOULD be evaluated quarterly

### A lock file does not constrain your consumers

A committed lock file makes **your** builds reproducible. It does not reach
anyone who installs your package: a published npm tarball, a PyPI wheel, a
Ruby gem — none of them carry the lock file. Consumers resolve your declared
ranges themselves, at their install time, and get whatever satisfies them then.

**When those two differ, your test suite is green about a combination nobody
installs — and that green is indistinguishable from a real one.**

This is the failure mode, observed rather than hypothesised: a project declared
`"tree-sitter-c-sharp": "^0.23.1"`. Three published versions satisfied that
range and they did not share an API. npm resolves a caret to the newest match,
so every fresh install received the incompatible one, and **no C# file ever
parsed for anyone who installed from the registry** — while the lock file
pinned the working version and every test passed, for the entire life of that
feature. The project's own source comments even documented the incompatible
version; the caret quietly re-admitted it.

Projects that **publish a package** therefore MUST additionally:

- **Know what a consumer's install resolves to.** Compare, per runtime
  dependency, the declared range, the locked version, and the version that
  range resolves to today. Report only the differences — a table of agreeing
  rows gets skimmed, and the ones that mattered go with it.
- **Declare native dependencies as exact versions.** Packages with a native
  binding (an install-family script, or a dependency on node-gyp / prebuild /
  node-addon-api / cmake-js and equivalents) MUST NOT be declared with a range.
  semver makes no promise about native ABI compatibility, and this has been
  broken inside a minor range in practice. Flag these **whether or not they are
  currently drifting**: a range matching exactly one published version is safe
  because upstream has not published again, not because anything guarantees it.
- **Run the test suite against consumer resolution before release.** Install
  without the lock file and run the real suite against the result. This is the
  only check in this section that does not need to be told in advance which
  dependency will break.
- **Treat a lookup that fails as unknown, never as agreement.** A check whose
  "everything is fine" and "I could not find out" look the same converts an
  unknown into a reassurance.

> **Applies to published artifacts, not to applications.** A deployed service
> ships its lock file with it, so its build and its runtime see the same
> versions. This section is about packages other people install.

## CI/CD Integration

### Pipeline Security Gate

Dependency scanning MUST be integrated into CI/CD:

```
PR Created → Dependency Scan → Results
                                  │
                    ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
                    ▼              ▼              ▼
              Critical         High           Medium/Low
              → Block PR       → Warn +       → Log only
                               Create Ticket
```

### Required Pipeline Steps

1. **SBOM Generation** — Produce SBOM on every build
2. **Vulnerability Scan** — Check against CVE databases
3. **License Scan** — Verify license compatibility
4. **Dependency Freshness** — Report outdated dependencies

## Dependency Health Assessment

### Health Metrics

| Metric | Healthy | Warning | Unhealthy |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Last update date** | < 6 months | 6-24 months | > 24 months |
| **Known CVEs** | 0 Critical/High | 1-2 High | Any Critical unpatched |
| **Maintainer count** | ≥ 3 | 2 | 1 (bus factor risk) |
| **Community activity** | Active issues/PRs | Slow response | Abandoned |
| **Download trends** | Stable or growing | Declining | Near zero |

### Health Score

Combine metrics into an overall health score:
- **Green** (Healthy): No warnings on any metric
- **Yellow** (Caution): 1-2 warning-level metrics
- **Red** (Action Required): Any unhealthy metric or Critical CVE

## Quick Reference Card

```
New dependency? → Check: License compatible? CVE-free? Maintained? Popular?
CI build?       → Auto-scan vulnerabilities + licenses
Release?        → Generate SBOM, review all warnings
Critical CVE?   → Patch within 48 hours
```
