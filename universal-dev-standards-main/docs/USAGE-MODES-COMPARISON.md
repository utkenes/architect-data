## Mode Comparison

### Quick Comparison Table

| Aspect | Skills Only | Standards Only | Skills + Standards |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Interactive Commands | 16 commands | None | 16 commands |
| Standards Depth | Medium | High | High |
| Token Usage | Low | Medium-High | High |
| Multi-Tool Support | Claude Code only | All 9 AI tools | All 9 AI tools |
| Version Control | External | Git tracked | Mixed |
| Customization | Limited | Full | Full |
| Learning Curve | Low | High | Low |

### Best For

| Mode | Recommended For |
|------|-----------------|
| **Skills Only** | Individual developers using Claude Code exclusively |
| **Standards Only** | Multi-tool teams, enterprise environments, offline use |
| **Skills + Standards** | Complete experience, learning UDS, team onboarding |

---

## Detailed Comparison

### Interactivity & User Experience

| Aspect | Skills Only | Standards Only | Skills + Standards |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Interactive commands | 16 available | None | 16 available |
| Context awareness | Auto-detect | Manual reading | Auto-detect |
| Workflow guidance | Step-by-step | Self-directed | Step-by-step |
| Learning curve | Low | High | Low |

**Notes**:
- Skills provide commands like `/commit`, `/tdd`, `/code-review` for interactive guidance
- Standards files require developers to actively read and apply
- Skills can auto-detect context (git status, project language)

### Content Completeness

| Aspect | Skills Only | Standards Only | Skills + Standards |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Standards depth | Medium | High | High |
| Example count | Condensed | Comprehensive | Comprehensive |
| Decision matrices | Partial | Complete | Complete |
| Version tracking | No | Yes | Yes |
| Cross-language examples | Partial | Complete | Complete |

**Notes**:
- Skills extract the essence of standards but omit some details
- Standards files contain complete decision trees, examples, and edge cases
- Features like large-scale refactoring patterns (`refactoring-standards.md`) have no Skills equivalent

### Tool Support

| Tool | Skills Only | Standards Only | Skills + Standards |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Claude Code | Full | Basic | Full |
| Cursor | Not supported | Supported | Supported |
| Windsurf | Not supported | Supported | Supported |
| Cline | Not supported | Supported | Supported |
| GitHub Copilot | Not supported | Supported | Supported |
| Other AI tools | Not supported | Supported | Supported |

**Notes**:
- Skills only support Claude Code
- Standards files can integrate with all 9 supported AI tools
- Multi-tool teams require standards files

### Maintenance & Updates

| Aspect | Skills Only | Standards Only | Skills + Standards |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Update method | Plugin auto-update | `uds update` | Mixed |
| Version control | External | Git tracked | Partial |
| Custom extensions | Limited | Full | Full |
| Team sync | Individual install | Git sync | Mixed |

**Notes**:
- Skills are managed centrally in Plugin Marketplace but cannot be version controlled
- Standards files can be committed to Git for team synchronization
- Custom rules require modifying standards files

### Token Efficiency

| Aspect | Skills Only | Standards Only | Skills + Standards |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Base token usage | Low | Medium-High | High |
| On-demand loading | Yes | No | Partial |
| Duplicate content | None | None | Some |

**Notes**:
- Skills load on-demand, consuming tokens only when invoked
- Standards files integrated into CLAUDE.md are loaded with every conversation
- Using both results in some content overlap

## Use Case Recommendations

### Scenario 1: Individual Developer + Claude Code Only

**Recommended Mode**: Skills Only (Mode A)

**Reasons**:
- Lowest token consumption
- Best interactive experience
- No extra files to manage
- `/commit`, `/tdd`, `/code-review` commands sufficient for daily use

**Configuration**:
```bash
uds init -y --skills-location marketplace
# standardsScope will be set to minimal
```

### Scenario 2: Team Development + Multiple AI Tools

**Recommended Mode**: Skills + Standards (Mode C)

**Reasons**:
- Standards files sync via Git for team consistency
- Non-Claude Code users can use standards files
- Skills provide better experience for Claude Code users

**Configuration**:
```bash
uds init -y --skills-location marketplace --content-mode index
# Select multiple AI tools during prompts
```

### Scenario 3: Enterprise Environment + Strict Compliance

**Recommended Mode**: Standards Only (Mode B)

**Reasons**:
- Full customization of standards content
- Complete version control and audit trail
- No dependency on external Plugin Marketplace
- Suitable for offline environments

**Configuration**:
```bash
uds init -y --skills-location none --content-mode full
```

### Scenario 4: Learning UDS Standards System

**Recommended Mode**: Skills + Standards (Mode C)

**Reasons**:
- Skills provide guided learning
- Standards files provide deep reference
- Compare Skills behavior with standards content
