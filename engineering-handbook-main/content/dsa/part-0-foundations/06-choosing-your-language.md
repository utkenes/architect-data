# Choosing your interview language

Friday at 10 a.m. you have a Meta phone screen. You write Java at work, but you've been doing LeetCode in Python for a month because the syntax is shorter. It is now Wednesday night. You have ninety seconds to pick the language you'll open the editor in on Friday and a hundred hours of practice already invested in the wrong direction. Pick.

That is the actual problem. The internet treats this question like a tournament bracket where one language wins; the data says otherwise. interviewing.io ran a quantitative analysis on roughly 3,000 logged technical interviews and found no statistically significant difference in pass rate as a function of language choice, with one exception at p = 0.037: candidates interviewing in Java were more likely to pass when the company's stack was Java.[^1] Their direct conclusion: "wielding your language of choice comfortably beats out showing off in a fancy-sounding language you don't know well, every time."[^1]

So the chapter does not crown a winner. It tells you when to switch, how late is too late, and which two cells in the gotcha table account for half the "my code worked locally" stories.

## Which language should I pick?

Default to **Python** if you don't already have a strong incumbent. Yangshun Tay, ex-Meta Staff Engineer and author of Blind 75, recommends Python, C++, Java, or JavaScript, with the canonical reason for the higher-level recommendation: "higher level languages like Python or Java provide standard library functions and data structures which allow you to translate solution to code more easily."[^2] His acceptable secondary list is Go, Ruby, PHP, C#, Swift, Kotlin. The list to *avoid*, because interviewers can't read them fluently, is Haskell, Erlang, Perl, C, MATLAB.[^2]

Python wins on three concrete axes. A sliding-window medium runs 15 to 25 lines in Python and 30 to 50 lines in Java. The standard library covers `Counter`, `deque`, `heapq`, `bisect`, `itertools`, and `lru_cache` out of the box. The whiteboard is forgiving: no type declarations, no class wrapper, slicing notation that compresses to one line.

Python loses on integer overflow only in the trick-question sense — it doesn't overflow, because `int` is arbitrary-precision per PEP 237.[^3] Java, C++, and Go all carry the overflow tax. See [Math for interviews](./04-math-for-interviews.md) and [Language idioms](./05-language-idioms.md) for the receipts.

The cases where you'd pick something else:

- **Stick with your day-job language if you already write it fluently.** Yangshun puts it directly: "If you have been using Java at work for a while now and do not have time to be comfortably familiar with another language, I would recommend just sticking to Java instead of picking up Python from scratch just for the sake of interviews."[^2] The switching cost is real and usually larger than the gain.
- **C++ for trading firms, ByteDance core systems, and Bloomberg.** Lowest TLE risk on the hardest problems and the cultural default at those shops.
- **Java for any large JVM shop.** Amazon, Bloomberg backend, parts of Microsoft Azure. The Java-at-Java-shop signal is the only language effect interviewing.io found in its data.[^1]
- **Go for Stripe, CNCF infrastructure shops, and back-end loops at Cloudflare and ByteDance infrastructure**, provided your target is not Google (see the next question).

Almost every other case: Python.

## Will my language work at my target company?

Yes, except at one place. Yangshun's *Tech Interview Handbook* documents the only hard restriction in the industry: "Most companies let you code in any language you want, the only exception I know being Google, where they only allow candidates to pick from Java, C++, JavaScript or Python for their algorithmic coding interviews."[^2] Go is acceptable on Google's job-board listings (the team uses it internally) but is not on the algorithmic-coding-round list.

The defaults at every other big-tech company are softer signals. They tell you what an experienced engineer at the company would notice without comment, not what they require. Most of the per-company guidance below comes from candidate reports and recruiter notes synthesized in the handbook's interview-research compilation, not from primary company documentation.[^4]

| Company | What candidates report | Hard restriction |
|---|---|---|
| Google | Python is most common in interviews; Java and C++ widely accepted | **Yes:** Java, C++, JavaScript, or Python only[^2] |
| Meta | Python for SWE-Product, C++ for infra, JavaScript for frontend; interviews accept any of the four[^4] | None for algorithmic rounds |
| Amazon | Java is the long-standing convention for backend, but Python is fully accepted; C++ for AWS systems[^4] | None |
| Microsoft | C# is the internal default for many teams; Java and Python equally welcomed[^4] | None |
| Apple | Team-dependent: iOS expects Swift or Objective-C; infra accepts Python, Java, C++, Go; ML expects Python[^4] | Per-team; ask the recruiter |
| Netflix | Python dominant for backend and data; Java in legacy services[^4] | None reported |
| Stripe | Stated policy is language-agnostic; in practice candidates use Ruby, Python, Go[^4] | None |
| ByteDance / TikTok | C++ for core systems, Go for infra, Python for ML[^4] | None reported |
| Bloomberg | C++ is the historical default (the terminal codebase); Python and Java fine[^4] | None |

The single call-out worth memorizing: if you're targeting Google and you've picked Go, switch the language or change the target. Every other row is a soft preference, not a wall.

## Does language signal differently at new-grad versus senior?

For new graduates, the only signal that matters is *fluency in any one language*. interviewing.io's data is unambiguous: the candidates who fail are not the ones who picked Java instead of Python. They are the ones who picked any language they weren't fluent in.[^1] The new-grad signal is "I can write fluent code in this language under time pressure," and Python satisfies that signal in the shortest practice time.

For senior candidates (L5+ / E5+), the calibration shifts. A senior writing Python at a heavily-Java shop doesn't fail the loop, but the interviewer notes the candidate didn't bother to learn the company's stack. interviewing.io's Java-at-Java-shop effect was statistically significant for general candidates and the magnitude is plausibly higher at senior level, where idiom expectations are tighter.[^1] If you're targeting one primary company, interview in their default language even if your day job is something else. Cost: 40 to 80 hours of ramp-up. Benefit: a signal that you already know what they use.

For staff and principal candidates, the round structure changes and language choice fades. Stripe's staff loop is a written one-pager and a presentation. Apple's senior loops include a deep-dive in the candidate's strongest area. Meta's E7+ candidates get the AI-assisted multi-file round, where day-job language wins by definition. Write whatever you write best.

## When is it too late to switch?

The cost of switching languages mid-prep grows superlinearly with hours invested. The numbers below come from the time required to re-internalize the eight cross-language idiom cells in [Language idioms](./05-language-idioms.md) (sort with comparator, hash map literal, deque, heap, recursion limit, generics, equality and hash, slicing) at roughly 30 to 90 minutes per cell, multiplied across 200 to 400 problems.

| Hours practiced | Switching cost | Recommendation |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 to 5 | trivial | Switch freely. The cost is one weekend. |
| 5 to 20 | 10 to 20 hours | Switch on a real reason: a target company's hard restriction, or a language you actually know better. |
| 20 to 50 | 30 to 60 hours | Switch only on a hard blocker: target became Google and you picked Go, or a missing standard-library piece keeps biting. |
| 50 to 200 | 60 to 150 hours | Don't switch. Work around the limitations. |
| 200+ | starting fresh | Don't switch under any circumstances. Ship with what you have. |

The operational rule is short: **decide in the first five hours, and only switch in the first twenty.** After that, the cost of switching is higher than the cost of working around whatever made you want to switch.

Real reasons to switch: your target shifted from a Python-friendly shop to Google and you picked Go; you're 30 hours in and Python's recursion-limit and dict-iteration-order semantics keep biting you on graph problems; you're joining a Java team in three months and want interview prep to double as on-job ramp.

Bad reasons to switch: "C++ looks more impressive" (interviewing.io's data does not support this; pass rate is statistically the same across languages[^1]); "the company uses Rust internally" (Rust is not a common interview language, and using something the interviewer can't read is a self-inflicted handicap[^2]); "I heard Python is faster to write" (true on average, but if you've already written 30 hours of Java the writing-speed gain is consumed by the re-learning cost).

## What gotchas should I watch out for?

A quick reference card. Each row is a real interview-ending bug, indexed by language. The depth lives in [Language idioms](./05-language-idioms.md); this is the at-a-glance version.

| Gotcha | Python | Java | C++ | Go |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Integer overflow | none (PEP 237)[^3] | yes (`int` is signed 32-bit, max `2^31 - 1`) | yes (signed overflow is UB) | yes (use `int64` or guard) |
| Default recursion depth | 1,000 (raise to `10**6` at module top) | ~5,000 to 20,000 (JVM stack ~1 MB) | ~50,000 to 200,000 (8 MB stack on Linux/macOS) | unbounded (goroutine stacks auto-grow) |
| Hash-map iteration order | insertion order (3.7+) | undefined in `HashMap`; use `LinkedHashMap` | undefined in `unordered_map` | undefined and randomized by design |
| Default heap polarity | min-heap (`heapq`) | min-heap (`PriorityQueue`) | **max-heap** (`std::priority_queue`) | depends on `Less` |
| Container front pop | `list.pop(0)` is O(n); use `collections.deque` | `LinkedList` works; `ArrayDeque` is faster | `std::deque` is canonical | `slice[1:]` is O(n) and aliases |
| Sort stability default | stable (TimSort) | stable for `Arrays.sort(Object[])`; not for `int[]` | not stable; use `std::stable_sort` | not stable; use `slices.SortStableFunc` |
| Comparator overflow | none | yes (`a - b` violates total order; use `Integer.compare`) | yes (subtract is UB on overflow) | yes (use `cmp.Compare`) |

Two rows account for the majority of "my code worked locally but failed the interview" anecdotes. The recursion-depth row catches you when a Python solution that worked on `n = 100` blows up at `n = 1,000` because it crosses the 1,000-frame default; `sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)` at the top of the file is the one-time fix. The integer-overflow row catches you when `a * b` quietly wraps in Java, C++, or Go; the fix is to widen to `long` / `long long` / `int64` *before* the multiply, not after.

## What to do this week

If you don't have an incumbent: open this chapter again, write `count_freqs("abracadabra")` in Python (it's two lines with `Counter`), and start with [Computational complexity and Big-O](./01-complexity-big-o.md). Sunk cost is currently zero. Decide before you cross the five-hour mark.

If you do have an incumbent: stay with it. The 40 to 80 hours you'd spend learning a new language don't pay back unless your incumbent is on Yangshun's avoid list (Haskell, Erlang, Perl, C, MATLAB) or your only target is Google and you currently write Go.

[Language idioms](./05-language-idioms.md) is the cross-language reference you'll come back to. [Part 14 — Interview framework](../part-14-interview-framework/00-pattern-recognition.md) is the broader prep mental model. The language is decided. The next 100 to 400 hours of practice are the part that actually matters.
