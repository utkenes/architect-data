// ── spine/pure/staged — every OFF-BUS input, as one closed set (5.4, 11.2) ─
// A step consumes things that did not come off the bus. There are exactly two
// kinds, and G12 says a closed set is sealed with its shared property declared ONCE
// on the parent:
//
//     Perceived   10.2 — untrusted content the world offered (a ticket, a webhook)
//     Recalled    11.2 — a peer tier's published conclusion, reached through recall
//
// Both carry `source`, so the committed record always says WHERE a staged value
// came from, and neither can be confused for the other at a consumer.
//
// Why this is one list and not two capture slots: 4.7 forbids a block a private
// capture log, and 5.4 already specifies plural off-bus inputs "in their staging
// order, keyed to the consuming step". StepRecord.staged IS that slot — the bus
// supplies the order and the step index is the key. ORDER IS PINNED:
// [Perceived?, Recalled?], perception first. The order reaches the rendered digest
// and therefore the committed ContextFixture, so it is law, not style.
//
// ZERO I/O. No async, no clock, no coroutines — gate check C8.
