/**
 * BASH AUDIT — a RECORD, not a gate. The distinction is the whole design.
 *
 * This host grants `(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`. An agent holding Bash holds root, so a PreToolUse
 * pattern-match on command strings is not a wall — it is a speed bump over an unbounded space of
 * spellings (`sed -i`, `perl -pi`, `tee`, `dd`, `printf >`, a base64'd heredoc, `python`… except
 * not that one). Concept #924 is explicit that mistaking such a filter for enforcement is the
 * error, so this module does not try.
 *
 * What it does instead is make wall-relevant Bash **conspicuous after the fact**. It runs on
 * PostToolUse, refuses nothing, and appends one line per matching command to an append-only log.
 * The design's own currency is that a bypass should be self-incriminating rather than impossible;
 * this is the ledger entry that makes it so.
 *
 * ZERO CONTEXT COST. It always returns null. The log is a file for a human or a watcher to read,
 * never an injection into the conversation — an audit that taxes every turn is an audit that gets
 * removed.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT DO, stated so nobody reads it as protection: an agent with root can delete or
 * rewrite the log. `chattr +a` does not help, because the same sudo that removes the guard removes
 * the attribute. The load-bearing defence remains dev/gates/ratchet.ts — it checks whether the
 * walls still WORK, whatever route was taken, and it runs in CI on a branch that cannot be
 * force-pushed. This log is corroboration, not evidence.
