/**
 * DELTA DIGEST — zero bytes when nothing changed.
 *
 * Fires per prompt. Reports only what MOVED in the ledger and matrix since the last turn, so a
 * session running alongside other seats notices their landings without polling.
 *
 * THE ZERO-BYTES-IDLE RULE IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. A digest that says "no changes" every turn is an
 * always-on tax: it costs tokens on every future turn forever, it trains the reader to skip the
 * block, and by the time something real appears there the habit of ignoring it is established.
 * Silence when idle is what makes the output worth reading when it is not silent.
 *
 * Hard-capped for the same reason. A digest that can grow without bound will, on exactly the turn
 * when a lot changed — which is the turn the reader can least afford a wall of text.
