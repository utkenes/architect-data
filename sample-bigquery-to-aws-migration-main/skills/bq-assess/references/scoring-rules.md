# Scoring Rules

> Source of truth: `src/bq_assess/scoring/effort.py` and `src/bq_assess/scoring/complexity.py`

## Two-Axis Model (ADR-0002)

Every entity is scored on two independent axes:

### Axis 1: Migration Effort (Tables only)

Scores the labor required to move data to S3 Tables (Iceberg).

| Factor | Condition | Points |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Data volume (large) | 1–100 GB | +1 |
| Data volume (huge) | >100 GB | +2 |
| Lossy casts | Per lossy type mapping | +1 each |
| Ongoing sync | Ingestion-time partition or `updated_at`-like column | +1 |
| Partition decision | `partition_decision_required` flag | +1 |
| Sort decision | `sort_decision_required` flag | +1 |

**NOT scored:** nesting depth, clean partitioning, clean clustering.

| Score | Category | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 0 | **AUTO** | Tool's DML moves it with no human input |
| 1–2 | **ASSISTED** | Flagged decisions need sign-off |
| 3+ | **MANUAL** | Human must design the load strategy |

**Confidence:** HIGH when `num_bytes` is known, LOW when `num_bytes` is None.

### Axis 2: Query Complexity (all entities with SQL surface)

Scores the rewrite effort for BigQuery-specific SQL constructs.

| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| JavaScript UDF invocation | +4 |
| UNNEST / array unnesting | +2 |
| ARRAY_* functions | +2 |
| Struct-path navigation | +1 |
| Function-name drift (per distinct function) | +1 each |
| Hub entity (≥3 dependents) | +1 |

| Score | Category | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 0 | **PORTABLE** | Runs on Redshift as-is |
| 1–3 | **ADAPT** | Minor dialect adaptation |
| 4+ | **REWRITE** | Full manual rewrite needed |

**Confidence ladder:**
- **LOW:** No SQL surface and no logs
- **MEDIUM:** Auto-captured view/UDF definitions present
- **HIGH:** Query logs add observed workload

## Placement (Views/MVs/UDFs)

- UDF → always Redshift (Iceberg has no function concept)
- View/MV → signal-based (default: Redshift with LOW confidence)
- MV with Iceberg placement → `refresh_unverified=True`
