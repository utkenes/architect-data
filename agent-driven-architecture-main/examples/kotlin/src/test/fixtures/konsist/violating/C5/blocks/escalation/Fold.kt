// BLOCK-TEST C5 (G9) — a fold arm reaches for the idempotency key.
// 14.6 rests the whole recovery-path safety claim on "the effect's id is its
// idempotency key", and no port ever built one: the same confirm applied twice
// paged on-call TWICE. The fix is that the key is derived from the COMMITTED step
// index, so it does not exist until bus.append() has returned — an arm that can
// name KeyedEffect is an arm that can invent one before the commit.
