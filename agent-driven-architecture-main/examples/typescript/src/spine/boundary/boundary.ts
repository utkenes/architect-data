// ── spine/boundary/boundary — THE ONE IMPURE SEAM (6.7, G9) ────────────────
// Clock, ids, bus, sink, authority, registry and the fold meet here and nowhere
// else. Nine ordered steps; three structural facts fall out of the order, and
// every implementation must preserve all three.
//
//  * COMMIT STRICTLY PRECEDES PERFORM — not by convention but because step 9
//    cannot run until step 7 has returned the StepIndex the key is built from.
//    14.6's ordering claim becomes unwritable-wrong.
//  * THE GATE RUNS BEFORE THE FOLD AND BEFORE THE COMMIT, so what is committed
//    is already the gate's verdict. A re-fold reproduces it without calling the
//    authorization seam again (G9).
//  * NOTHING DOWNSTREAM OF STEP 4 CAN LEARN WHO ACTED EXCEPT THROUGH `sig`. The
//    results were produced in step 3, before the signature existed. G1's
//    two-unreconciled-actor-values problem cannot recur, because there is only
//    one value and it is created after the tool has returned.
//
// AND NOTHING UPSTREAM OF STEP 4 CAN CHOOSE IT EITHER. `by` is a parameter of the
// CHANNEL a caller was handed, never a field of the step it submits, so the value
// fed to `authorityOf` is decided in this file and nowhere else.
