// ── spine/concurrency/consumer — the barge-in loop that ACTUALLY PREEMPTS (12) ─
//
// 12.3, restated so it cannot be re-shipped. The book's 12.3 drain loop puts
// `outcome = await(inFlight)` at LOOP-BODY indentation while `mailbox.take()` blocks
// at the top. Under the ordinary reading of await, control never reaches take()
// during a turn: `turnInFlight` is false at every take(), all three guards are dead,
// and Fig 12.1's mid-turn "take Interrupt" is unproducible. The loop cannot preempt.
//
// THE FIX IS ONE LINE OF SHAPE: a `select` over { a message arrived, the turn
// settled }, so a message is observable WHILE a turn runs.
//
//     select {
//         mailbox.messages.onReceive { Arrived(it) }     ← the whole fix
//         running?.job?.onJoin      { Settled }
//     }
//
// `select` is ATOMIC — a losing `onReceive` clause does not consume — so Kotlin
// needs no re-arm bookkeeping and no message can be raced into a hole.
//
// THE THREE POLICIES (12.2/12.3), each with a test that proves it:
//
//   Input      per SOURCE, a closed choice, defaulting to DurableQueue.
//              Perishable   → conflate to the newest; a busy-drop FOLDS A COUNTER.
//              DurableQueue → never conflate; dedupe on the key; ack after commit.
//   Interrupt  PREEMPT: cancel the in-flight turn and JOIN it before the interrupt's
//              turn starts, so two folds can never interleave.
//   Drain      DEFER: wait for the running turn, then finalize. NEVER cancels.
//
// THE RUN-STATE HANDLE EXISTS, and denying it is what made 12.3 unimplementable.
// Its safety does not come from being absent; it comes from SINGLE-CONSUMER
// OWNERSHIP: exactly one loop reads or writes it, so it is never shared and needs no
// lock. That is the difference between "no mutable state" (false) and "no SHARED
// mutable state" (true, and the whole point).
//
// THE TURN RUNNER IS INJECTED, NOT IMPORTED. This folder never names the agent-loop
// SDK — that stays confined to spine/agent/loop (G3, gate check C1) — and it
// never names a block or the root (C15).
//
// DISPATCHER CONFINEMENT (law, and not gate-checkable — see the README's
// specified-but-unproven table). The consumer creates the turn's scope, and `submit`
// is reached only through the closure minted here, on the consumer's own dispatcher.
// No turn can reach the boundary from another thread, so the commit stays serial.
//
// ACTOR CONFINEMENT is a different claim, and a checkable one. The turn's channel
// forwards to the boundary's AGENT channel; this consumer's own authored steps go to
// its SPINE channel; and a FinishedStep carries no Actor at all, so neither can be
// redirected by its payload.
