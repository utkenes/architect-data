.. index:: MSS: Maximum Segment Size

|TCP|.5 Triggering Transmission
--------------------------------

We next consider a surprisingly subtle issue: how TCP decides to
transmit a segment. As described earlier, TCP supports a byte-stream
abstraction; that is, application programs write bytes into the stream,
and it is up to TCP to decide that it has enough bytes to send a
segment. What factors govern this decision?

If we ignore the possibility of flow control—that is, we assume the
window is wide open, as would be the case when a connection first
starts—then TCP has three mechanisms to trigger the transmission of a
segment. First, TCP maintains a variable, typically called the *maximum
segment size* (``MSS``), and it sends a segment as soon as it has
collected ``MSS`` bytes from the sending process. ``MSS`` is usually set
to the size of the largest segment TCP can send without causing the
local IP to fragment. That is, ``MSS`` is set to the maximum
transmission unit (MTU) of the directly connected network, minus the
size of the TCP and IP headers. The second thing that triggers TCP to
transmit a segment is that the sending process has explicitly asked it
to do so. Specifically, TCP supports a *push* operation, and the sending
process invokes this operation to effectively flush the buffer of unsent
bytes. The final trigger for transmitting a segment is that a timer
fires; the resulting segment contains as many bytes as are currently
buffered for transmission. However, as we will soon see, this “timer”
isn’t exactly what you expect.

|TCP|.5.1 Silly Window Syndrome
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Of course, we can’t just ignore flow control, which plays an obvious
role in throttling the sender. If the sender has ``MSS`` bytes of data
to send and the window is open at least that much, then the sender
transmits a full segment. Suppose, however, that the sender is
accumulating bytes to send, but the window is currently closed. Now
suppose an ACK arrives that effectively opens the window enough for the
sender to transmit, say, ``MSS/2`` bytes. Should the sender transmit a
half-full segment or wait for the window to open to a full ``MSS``? The
original specification was silent on this point, and early
implementations of TCP decided to go ahead and transmit a half-full
segment. After all, there is no telling how long it will be before the
window opens further.

It turns out that the strategy of aggressively taking advantage of any
available window leads to a situation now known as the *silly window
syndrome*. :numref:`Figure %s <fig-sillywindow>` helps visualize what
happens.  If you think of a TCP stream as a conveyor belt with “full”
containers (data segments) going in one direction and empty containers
(ACKs) going in the reverse direction, then ``MSS``-sized segments
correspond to large containers and 1-byte segments correspond to very
small containers. As long as the sender is sending ``MSS``-sized
segments and the receiver ACKs at least one ``MSS`` of data at a time,
everything is good (:numref:`Figure %s(a) <fig-sillywindow>`). But,
what if the receiver has to reduce the window, so that at some time
the sender can’t send a full ``MSS`` of data? If the sender
aggressively fills a smaller-than-\ ``MSS`` empty container as soon as
it arrives, then the receiver will ACK that smaller number of bytes,
and hence the small container introduced into the system remains in
the system indefinitely.  That is, it is immediately filled and
emptied at each end and is never coalesced with adjacent containers to
create larger containers, as in :numref:`Figure %s(b)
<fig-sillywindow>`. This scenario was discovered when early
implementations of TCP regularly found themselves filling the network
with tiny segments.

   Silly window syndrome. (a) As long as the sender sends
   MSS-sized segments and the receiver ACKs one MSS at a time, the
   system works smoothly. (b) As soon as the sender sends less than
   one MSS, or the receiver ACKs less than one MSS, a small
   "container" enters the system and continues to circulate.

Note that the silly window syndrome is only a problem when either the
sender transmits a small segment or the receiver opens the window a
small amount. If neither of these happens, then the small container is
never introduced into the stream. It’s not possible to outlaw sending
small segments; for example, the application might do a *push* after
sending a single byte. It is possible, however, to keep the receiver
from introducing a small container (i.e., a small open window). The rule
is that after advertising a zero window the receiver must wait for space
equal to an ``MSS`` before it advertises an open window.

Since we can’t eliminate the possibility of a small container being
introduced into the stream, we also need mechanisms to coalesce them.
The receiver can do this by delaying ACKs—sending one combined ACK
rather than multiple smaller ones—but this is only a partial solution
because the receiver has no way of knowing how long it is safe to delay
waiting either for another segment to arrive or for the application to
read more data (thus opening the window). The ultimate solution falls to
the sender, which brings us back to our original issue: When does the
TCP sender decide to transmit a segment?

|TCP|.5.2 Nagle’s Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returning to the TCP sender, if there is data to send but the window
is open less than ``MSS``, then we may want to wait some amount of
time before sending the available data, but the question is how long?
If we wait too long, then we hurt interactive applications like SSH.
If we don’t wait long enough, then we risk sending a bunch of tiny
packets and falling into the silly window syndrome. The answer is to
introduce a timer and to transmit when the timer expires.

While we could use a clock-based timer—for example, one that fires
every 100 ms—Nagle introduced an elegant *self-clocking* solution. The
idea is that as long as TCP has any data in flight, the sender will
eventually receive an ACK. This ACK can be treated like a timer
firing, triggering the transmission of more data. Nagle’s algorithm
provides a simple, unified rule for deciding when to transmit:

::

   When the application produces data to send
       if both the available data and the window >= MSS
           send a full segment
       else
           if there is unACKed data in flight
               buffer the new data until an ACK arrives
           else
               send all the new data now

In other words, it’s always OK to send a full segment if the window
allows. It’s also all right to immediately send a small amount of data
if there are currently no segments in transit, but if there is anything
in flight the sender must wait for an ACK before transmitting the next
segment. Thus, an interactive application like Telnet that continually
writes one byte at a time will send data at a rate of one segment per
RTT. Some segments will contain a single byte, while others will contain
as many bytes as the user was able to type in one round-trip time.
Because some applications cannot afford such a delay for each write it
does to a TCP connection, the socket interface allows the application to
turn off Nagle’s algorithm by setting the ``TCP_NODELAY`` option.
Setting this option means that data is transmitted as soon as possible.
