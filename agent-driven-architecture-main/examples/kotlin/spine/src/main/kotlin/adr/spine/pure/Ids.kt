// ── spine/pure/ids — the value vocabulary every seam speaks ─────────────────
// ZERO I/O, zero behaviour. These are the names the sealed transport hierarchies
// are built out of, so a String can never be mistaken for a tool name and an
// index can never be mistaken for a timestamp.
//
// Why the ticket/panel ids live in the SPINE and not in a block: three blocks
// (triage, escalation, console) each hold a slice keyed by TicketId, and G11
// forbids a block naming a sibling. A shared opaque id type is the only legal
// home for a vocabulary two blocks must both be able to spell. It carries no
// domain logic — that stays in the owning block.
