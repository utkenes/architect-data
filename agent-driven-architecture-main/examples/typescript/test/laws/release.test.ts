// ── THE RELEASE CHECK'S OWN BLOCK-TEST AND ALLOW-TEST ─────────────────────
//
// 15.2's bar, applied to the release check: the pure function in release.ts is
// run against checked-in VIOLATING inputs it must reject case by case, and a
// COMPLIANT set it must pass in silence. Every rejection below is asserted by
// its own named case against its own specific message — never "problems is
// non-empty" — so weakening one predicate goes red on its own.
//
// THE LIVE HALF IS THE POINT, and it is what stops this going the way C7's
// derivation went. The fixtures are frozen text; the live cases below read the
// SHIPPED marker files and compare the text the regex extracts against the value
// the module actually exports. Rename the constant and the extraction reports a
// MISSING marker rather than silently matching nothing, and the runtime
// comparison goes red at the same time. A frozen-fixture-only version of this
// file would stay green while the rule stopped binding to anything.
//
// AND THE COMPLIANT SET IS DELIBERATELY TWO CORPORA, NOT ONE. A single-entry
// CHANGELOG is the easiest thing to be accidentally right about: a rule pinned
// to "the log holds exactly this one heading" passes every case a one-entry tree
// can present and turns red on the FIRST release the ritual prescribes. So the
// second compliant corpus is a real two-entry log at `spine-2`, and the rules
// below are stated as RELATIONSHIPS to the marker — newest heading equals it,
// entry count equals its ordinal — which hold at every future value.
//
// The fixture corpora are plain `.txt` and `.md` rather than real `.ts` and
// `.kt`: this checker keys on the text of a declaration and not on a file
// extension, so giving them source extensions would buy nothing and cost three
// build-config exclusions (tsconfig, biome, eslint) that the citation lint's
// fixtures need only because that lint reads extensions.
