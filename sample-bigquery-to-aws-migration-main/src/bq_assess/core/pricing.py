"""BigQuery pricing-model detection — on-demand vs capacity / Editions (R16, V4/V5).

``PricingDetector.detect()`` classifies how a Source is billed so the Cost Comparison (R18)
prices the BigQuery side against the *real* model, never an assumed one (R16.4). It resolves
to exactly four outcomes:

  1. ``--reservation-config`` supplied        → CAPACITY + figures, HIGH confidence (R16.2)
  2. JOBS carry a non-null ``reservation_id``  → CAPACITY + edition, MEDIUM (figures unknown)
  3. JOBS all-NULL ``reservation_id``          → ON_DEMAND, MEDIUM (lookback-window caveat)
  4. no usable signal (empty / all-SCRIPT /    → ON_DEMAND, LOW, prompt for --reservation-config
     missing ``jobs.listAll``)                   (R16.3 / P20: never silently guess capacity)

The primary signal is ``INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS.reservation_id`` (NULL ⇒ on-demand, non-null ⇒
capacity) — verified V5, simpler than reading the reservation views and needing no perms beyond
``jobs.listAll``. SCRIPT *parent* jobs report NULL ``reservation_id`` even under capacity, so
they are excluded before classification (V5 caveat).

The detector never returns ``model == UNKNOWN`` and never raises: an undeterminable verdict
collapses to ON_DEMAND at LOW confidence with a prompting ``source_note`` (R16.3). Verified
constants live in ``core/pricing_constants.py`` (dated, overridable; read at call time).

⚠️ Scope (issue 5.1): the model is classified from JOBS; capacity slot *figures* come only from
``--reservation-config``. Auto-reading baseline/max/commitment out of the reservation views is
deferred (their column schema is unverified — see SCRUM_NOTES § Detector scope 2026-06-15), so
auto-detected CAPACITY is reported at MEDIUM with a prompt for ``--reservation-config``.
