## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **A gate that checks whether a `uds <cmd>` instruction actually runs (XSPEC-383 R4).** 2026-08-19 found three top-level commands (`uds install`, `uds lint`, `uds sync`) and two flags (`uds check --spec-size`, `uds spec create --boost`) shipped in guidance that do not exist — including in `quickstart.js`, whose entire job is "find the right command", and `integration-generator.js`, which writes commands into every adopter's `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`. Both were already fixed (`465335e4`); nothing was checking that the fix stays fixed. `check-command-existence.mjs` walks `core/`, `locales/`, `ai/standards/`, `cli/src/`, `skills/`, `docs/`, and repo-root `*.md`, extracts every `uds <cmd>` shape, and probes each against this commit's own CLI with `uds <path> --definitely-not-a-real-flag` — not `--help`, which commander answers with the general command list for an *unknown* command instead of erroring, which is exactly how `uds lint`/`uds sync` survived the first pass undetected. Flags are probed with two trailing sentinel options so a value-taking flag can never accidentally consume the sentinel and let the real command execute. Wired into CI on its own `command-existence` change-filter (not the existing `cli` one — its source surface is not `cli/**`).
- Re-running the same probe against the current tree surfaced further drift the first incident's fix never touched: `uds workflow` (removed in v6.0.0) was still shown as live in `docs/user/CHEATSHEET.md`, `docs/reference/FEATURE-REFERENCE.md`, and `skills/workflows/README.md` (and their zh-TW/zh-CN mirrors) for five months, despite `docs/MIGRATION-v6.md` itself giving the exact grep that would have caught it. `uds config --lang`/`--mode` (root `README.md` and both locales, plus `docs/reference/INTEGRATION-VERIFICATION.md`) never existed as flags — correct usage is `uds config set output_language <value>` / `uds config --type content_mode`. `uds agent install --all` used a flag where the CLI takes a positional (`uds agent install all`). `uds reverse-tdd` was invented for a GitHub Actions example (`skills/reverse-engineer/tdd-analysis.md` ×3 locales) — that capability ships only as the `reverse-tdd` AI agent, not a scriptable CLI, and the example now says so instead of showing a fabricated `coverage.json` pipeline. `uds check --interactive` (`cli/src/i18n/messages.js` ×3 locales) doesn't exist because interactive mode is already the default (`--no-interactive` disables it). 29 findings, 29 fixed, 0 remaining.

## [6.7.5] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- **Eight skills can be selected by a model again.** `audit-assistant`, `changelog-guide`, `commit-standards`, `docs-generator`, `project-discovery`, `release-standards`, `reverse-engineer` and `spec-derivation` carried `disable-model-invocation: true`, applied by `d415937e` alongside the description rewrite and following no stateable rule. They were deliberately left alone on 2026-08-17 for a reason that was correct then: the rule settled on was "a reference is model-invocable", and none of these carried a `status` at all, so lifting them would have replaced one unruled state with one unruled action. Measured since: **all eight carry a full `Use when:` trigger and a `Not for:` exclusion, all eight describe an action rather than reference material, and all eight already have a paired slash command** — which is exactly the shape of `code-review-assistant`, whose `/code-review` was ruled not to justify the flag. `journey-test-assistant` is the standing precedent: same "Generate X" shape, `status: stable`, never disabled. Each now records `status: stable` with the reasoning inline. `stable` rather than a new value, because `skills/` uses reference, stable and experimental and inventing a fourth would be the same unruled action in different clothing.
- **The count of skills a model can actually select is now 55 of 55.** It was 45.

### Fixed

- **A localized install still shipped the flag after the English source dropped it.** `spec-derivation` is the only skill whose locale packs carried `disable-model-invocation` of their own, and frontmatter merging only copies fields the English source *has* — so a field English no longer declares survives untouched in the locale file and ships anyway. Both zh-TW and zh-CN corrected. Verified by resolving all **60 skills × 3 locales = 165 installed results**: zero still disabled.

## [6.7.4] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **6.7.3 made `uds check` report 52 phantom missing files per repo.** Two 6.7.3 changes only interact once both are present: R1 gave skills a content hash, which made them reach the `unchanged` branch for the first time, and R6b collects entries from that branch into `manifest.fileHashes`. That map is validated with an `isFile()` test and skill entries are directories, so every one of them reported as missing. **Nothing was deleted — the record was wrong, not the disk** (verified: 59 skill directories and their contents intact). `verifiedPristine` is now restricted to file-backed categories, and because fixing the writer does not remove what it already wrote, `uds update` also drops `.claude/skills/` and `.claude/commands/` keys it finds in `fileHashes` — a bad key is never revisited otherwise, since nothing on disk corresponds to it.
- **Commands now compare by content too (XSPEC-382 R7).** R1 covered skills and left commands on `hash: null`, keeping the unconditional-reinstall branch alive for them. Same shape as the skills fix: `resolveCommandContent(name, agent, locale)` says what an install would contain — locale selection with English fallback, plus the per-agent transform — and the installer writes it while the planner hashes it.
- **Localized installs shipped SKILL.md files pointing at files that were never installed.** Locale packs are not complete copies of the English source — measured, **4 of 59 localized skills in zh-TW and 5 of 59 in zh-CN** are missing files English ships — and the installer swapped in the locale directory wholesale, so those companions were simply not written. Two of the gaps are referenced: the zh-TW `dev-workflow-guide/SKILL.md` points at `workflow-phases.md` three times and `testing-guide/SKILL.md` at `test-skeleton-templates.md` three times. **Fallback is now per file rather than per skill** — locale file where it exists, English where it does not.
- **A file UDS does not ship no longer keeps a skill permanently "changed".** Installing a skill now removes top-level files in its directory that the resolution does not name (found in the wild: `deploy-assistant/guide.md`, which is in no UDS skills tree and never was). Scoped by the same provenance test that keeps an adopter's own skill directories out of every path here — verified that a hand-written skill directory and its extra files survive `--force` untouched — and subdirectories are left alone, since the installer has never written them.

## [6.7.3] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **Skills now compare by content, so upgrades stop reprinting 55 rows that mean nothing.** Both sides of the diff hardcoded `hash: null`, so every skill was an unconditional reinstall. Hashing the source directory does not work — installing is not a verbatim copy: a localized `SKILL.md` gets English frontmatter merged in (`brainstorm-assistant`: a 23,753-byte zh-TW source becomes 23,866 bytes installed), the source is chosen at runtime by locale with per-skill fallback to English, and subdirectories are skipped. Built that way, all 55 would show as content **changes** on every upgrade — indistinguishable from real ones, and worse than the known absence of signal. Instead there is one function: `resolveSkillFiles(name, locale)` says what an install would contain, the installer writes that, and the planner hashes it, so the two cannot drift. Verified against a real installed project — 110 files byte-identical, 0 mismatches, and the 18 adopter-written skills correctly unresolved. The actual side hashes **only UDS-managed directories**; an adopter's own skills are never compared and never become deletion candidates. `Update (57)` on a real upgrade is now `Update: 0, Unchanged: 127`.
- **`uds check --restore` could not restore 64 of 72 tracked standards.** It matched `entry.endsWith(fileName)` against `manifest.standards`, whose entries have been IDs (`commit-message`) rather than paths since 3.4.0 — a comparison that can never be true. The eight that worked were the `options/` entries, still stored as paths, which is why the failure never looked total; the rest reported "Could not determine source". The same ID-to-source lookup already existed twice elsewhere in the file and this site never got a copy, so the fix is one resolver in `registry.js`, paired with the filename resolver it has to agree with.
- **A byte-perfect standard could not stop being reported as modified.** Actual state is hashed from disk, so a file matching upstream is classed `unchanged`, produces no action, and is never re-hashed — and reconciliation returned early without writing the manifest when the plan was empty. There was no path back. The diff now reports the files it **proved** identical to upstream and those records are corrected before that early return. Deliberately narrow: it only ever records a hash after proving disk matches the desired upstream content, so a hand edit is never absorbed. Syncing the record to whatever is on disk would leave `uds check` unable to report a modified standard ever again.
- **Backups did not contain skills, and nothing said so.** Skills are directories and the backup called `copyFileSync` on them, which throws on every platform (ENOTSUP measured on two filesystems here — not a temp-directory artifact). The failure was hidden twice: the executor aborted only when **nothing** backed up, so a single success concealed any number of failures, and the backup manifest had no errors field, making a backup of 74 of 129 planned paths indistinguishable on disk from a complete one. Measured on a real repo before the fix: a backup manifest recorded 74 paths for a plan of 129 actions, with **0 of the 55 skill directories** among them — a rollback point that did not cover the largest part of what it was about to overwrite. Directories now copy recursively, the manifest records `failedToBackUp` and `coverage: {planned, backedUp, failed}`, and **any** backup failure aborts the run: refusing to overwrite a file that could not be copied first is what a backup is for.

### Changed

- **The unconditional-reinstall collapse is kept, and its wording widened.** Commands still have no content comparison, so the branch is live. It is not removed along with the skills half because a collapse that silently stops applying looks exactly like a plan that had nothing to collapse.

## [6.7.2] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **`uds update --skills` updated everything and never advanced the version marker.** Four of five adopter repos sat on 6.6.0 while the same manifest's `skills.version` already read 6.7.0; the only one that advanced was the one with no skills installed. Both runs exited 0, both printed "57 succeeded", and neither printed a failure. The earlier reading of this — that something reported failure and it never surfaced — was wrong. Probes showed `results=57 failing=0`, the registry version resolving to `"6.7.1"`, and the value about to be written being correct: **the reconciler did everything right and a later write undid it.** `update.js` loads the manifest once at the top of the command, before the reconciler runs, and `updateSkillsOnly()` then writes that stale in-memory object back over it. `updateCommandsOnly()` had the identical defect and was found by traversing rather than by hitting it. Both now re-read the manifest and apply **only the fields they own** — copying the whole object back would re-open the same defect for any field a later step adds. This matters because the mechanism's own comment says it exists so the weekly staleness scout, which reads exactly this field, stops misreporting.
- **A plan that listed 57 changes, 55 of them unconditional.** Skills carry no content comparison (XSPEC-382 R1), so every upgrade reprinted the same 55 rows with one identical reason, burying the two rows a reviewer actually had to approve. They are now collapsed into a single line **that states how many were collapsed**, with the total unchanged — a cap that does not announce itself reads as "these are all of them". The Summary line likewise now reads `Update: 57 (2 changed, 55 unconditional reinstall)`; `Update: 57` alone was true and answered nothing, and the Summary is what you read when deciding whether to approve an upgrade.

### Changed

- **The reason string for unconditional reinstalls is a single exported constant** rather than one copy at the site that produces it and another at the site that renders it. Drift between two copies would be silent here: the collapse would simply stop collapsing and the plan would look exactly as it always had.

### Testing

- **A behavioural test for the version marker, alongside the existing shape test.** The regression test added with the fix asserts source text — that the two functions contain `readManifest(projectPath)` — which would stay green for a refactor that calls it and discards the result. The claim being made is behavioural, so `tests/e2e/update-version-advances.test.js` now runs a real install, seeds a probe version, runs `update --apply --yes --skills`, and asserts the marker moved. Verified in both directions: green with the fix, red with it reverted.
- Both new suites assert **both arms**. The collapse test checks that ordinary plans are left untouched, because a test that only checks "the 55 are gone" passes equally for a renderer that drops every update row.

## [6.7.1] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **The localized cheat sheets embedded English skill descriptions — for every locale, always.** `scripts/generate-usage-docs.mjs` scanned skills once, before the language loop, and always from `skills/` (the English source), so all three cheat sheets and feature references shared one set of descriptions. Measured before the fix: **all 82 descriptions in `locales/zh-TW/docs/CHEATSHEET.md` were byte-identical to the English ones** — and they were the pre-6.7.0 stripped `[UDS] <label>` form, so a Traditional Chinese reader saw a stale description in the wrong language while the `SKILL.md` they had installed carried the full Chinese trigger surface. `scanSkills()` now takes a language and is called **inside** the loop, preferring the locale variant and falling back to English per skill when one is missing. Fixed in the generator rather than in the 82 rows: a hand-edited cheat sheet is guaranteed to diverge from `SKILL.md` on the next edit.
- **`disable-model-invocation: true` removed from `code-review-assistant` and `checkin-assistant`.** The flag followed no stateable rule. Of the six skills carrying `status: reference`, **four (`tdd`, `bdd`, `atdd`, `pr-automation`) were never disabled** despite the identical XSPEC-095 relocation of their lifecycle to the adoption layer — same category, opposite treatment — and the other eight disabled skills carry no `status` at all. The system had already recorded the consequence: `pr-automation-assistant` routes *"the substance of the review itself — use `/code-review`"*, and that referral was unreachable from any model-initiated path. All six references are now treated alike, which makes the rule statable: **a reference is model-invocable**. Both files carry the reasoning inline. The remaining eight are deliberately untouched — they have no `status`, so lifting them would replace one unruled state with another unruled action; they are named in XSPEC-378 R5 rather than left unexplained.

## [6.7.0] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **Skill trigger surface restored across all three layers — 55 skills × English, zh-TW, zh-CN.** A skill's `description` is the only thing a model sees when deciding whether to invoke it. Commit `d415937e` (2026-02-10) rewrote 17 of them to `[UDS] <label>` and deleted the `Use when:` and `Keywords:` lines, **Chinese keywords included**; the neighbouring commit's title says `token optimization`. Only tokens were countable — nothing was measuring trigger surface, so the trade looked one-sided when it was not. Measured on 2026-08-14: of 55 skills carrying a `SKILL.md`, **27 had a trigger condition, 27 had keywords, 0 had an exclusion condition, and 28 had neither** — and the 28 were the methodology core: tdd, bdd, atdd, spec-driven-dev, code-review, commit-standards, checkin, requirement.
  - **English source**: 28 restored, and **all 55 gained an exclusion condition** (`Not for:`). Adding triggers without exclusions buys over-triggering, and a skill that fires when it should not gets switched off entirely — taking the working ones with it. Of the 15 recoverable from git history, **8 were rewritten** because the historical text no longer described current behaviour: six claim to drive a lifecycle that moved to the adoption layer in XSPEC-095. Restoring a stale description is worse than restoring none.
  - **Locale layers**: zh-TW and zh-CN, **55/55 each, translated rather than transcoded**. This half is the point — a project installing with `--locale zh-tw` was still receiving the stripped descriptions while the English source was already fixed, so the repair would not have reached the reader it was for. Traditional and Simplified are each written in their own idiom, and three zh-CN descriptions that had Traditional characters mixed in were corrected.
  - **Translation drift 62 → 38**, and the remaining 38 is a deliberate stop: 24 files whose drift came only from this description edit had their hashes updated, while 12 whose bodies had already drifted keep their stale hashes — updating those would assert a whole-file sync nobody verified.
  - ⚠️ **Ten of the 28 carry `disable-model-invocation: true`**, added by the same `d415937e`. For those, a description does not restore selectability — the flag does, and whether to lift it is a design decision rather than a defect. The count of skills a model can actually select is **45, not 55**.

### Added

- **`ai-response-navigation` 1.2.0 → 1.3.0 — optional R10 and R11.** Their source is not the same as R7–R9's: a user stating twice in one session that a correct and complete answer was unreadable, while R7–R9 had already shipped and were being followed. Leading with the finding was not enough.
  - **R10 — plain language is the subject; identifiers are support.** *Trigger*: any response explaining a situation, a defect, or a system's behaviour to a human. Explain what happened in the words the reader would use; paths, symbols, line numbers, command output and version strings belong **after** the sentence they support, not as the sentence. It does **not** license omitting them — a reader who wants to verify must be able to. **Deliberately separate from R7**: R7 orders finding before evidence, and a response can lead with its finding while stating it in vocabulary only its author holds. Both leave the reader unable to act; they are different failures.
  - **R11 — every option carries its own trade-off.** *Trigger*: a response asking the reader to choose between two or more courses of action. Rule 2 already requires marking the recommendation and giving *its* reason; R11 requires **each** option to state what it buys and what it costs. A list where only the recommendation is argued hands the comparison back to the reader — the work they asked to have done — and an option shown without a downside reads as having none. **A trade-off is not a hedge**: "slightly harder" is not a cost, "rewrites 110 files and needs a human to check the translations" is. An empty cost cell reads as "not analysed", and the reader cannot tell those apart.

## [6.6.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- **`spec-driven-development` 2.3.0 → 2.4.0 — an AC with no verification item is not an AC.** Every acceptance criterion must have a **verification item that points at it** — a test, a check, a gate, or an explicitly recorded manual step. An AC that no verification item references is a promise nobody kept, and it does **not** fail loudly: it simply stops being true while the spec continues to assert it. **Rule**: such an AC must be **demoted to a design intent**, not carried as an AC — demotion is honest, an unverified AC is not. The standard also states what does *not* count: "a reviewer will notice" is not a verification item, because the reviewer reads the spec, and the spec says the AC holds. Adds rule `SDD-AC-VERIFIED`.
  - **The measured instance**: a 2026-05-14 spec carried `AC-7: the legacy system-report is fully preserved, no regression`. Its Test Plan had seven items and **none pointed at AC-7**. The report's timer was disabled and its deploy function was never called — **from the same day the AC was written**. It surfaced three months later, by accident, while verifying an unrelated install. It was not wired to a check and later came loose; **it was never wired at all**.

- **`ai-response-navigation` 1.1.0 → 1.2.0 — optional rules R7–R9 governing the answer itself** (XSPEC borrow B-10, from [`ayghri/i-have-adhd`](https://github.com/ayghri/i-have-adhd), MIT). Rules 1–6 govern what comes *after* the answer: a Navigation Footer, a marked recommendation, a template matched to the response type. Nothing governed the answer. A response could therefore bury its conclusion under a wall of evidence and still satisfy **every rule in this standard** by appending a correct footer — and a reader who cannot find the answer is not helped by being told what to do next.
  - **R7 — lead with the finding, not the process.** *Trigger*: a response that answers a question, reports an investigation result, or presents a decision. The first line states what was found or what to do — not the method, not a restatement of the request, not a plan for answering. Evidence (`file:line`, command output, tables, measurements) is **support** and belongs after the claim it supports; leading with it forces the reader to reconstruct the conclusion themselves, which is the work they asked to have done. This orders the evidence; it does **not** license omitting it.
  - **R8 — restate state each turn.** *Trigger*: work spanning 3 or more exchanges, or a task with 3 or more steps. One line on where the work stands. The reader cannot be assumed to hold "we are on step 3 of 5" across messages, and restating it costs a sentence. Composes with Template 4 (*In Progress*): R8 governs the opening, the template governs the footer.
  - **R9 — no preamble.** *Trigger*: any substantive response. Generalizes an existing prohibition: [`anti-sycophancy-prompting`](core/anti-sycophancy-prompting.md) already forbids *"opening critique with positive affirmation"*, but only for critiques. R9 extends the same prohibition to every substantive response for a different reason — not flattery, but the delay it puts between the reader and the answer. **R9 does not apply to closers**; R1's Navigation Footer requirement stands.
  - **3 of the source's 10 rules were taken; the reasons for dropping the other 7 are recorded in the standard itself**, not only in a backlog. Two duplicate R1–R2. Three conflict with this standard or others: its *"no recap / no closers"* directly contradicts R1's Navigation Footer, its *"cap lists at 5 items"* would truncate evidence tables and traversal denominators, and its *"specific time estimates"* is already governed by [`estimation-standards`](core/estimation-standards.md).
  - **Optional in the same sense as R6** (model tier annotation): adopters need not enable them, existing skills need no retroactive change, and a project MAY promote any of them to required in its own configuration. **What is not optional is that each carries a precise trigger** — a rule phrased too loosely to fire is indistinguishable from not having the rule, which is the failure mode recorded in XSPEC-378.
  - Extends the **existing** standard rather than adding a new one: a second standard covering "how an AI writes to a human reader" would put two implementations on one axis.

## [6.5.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- **Five reinforcements to four existing standards, borrowed from `AmazingAng/old-coder`** (XSPEC borrow B-01). No new standard was created; each cut is a clause inside a standard that already existed. Two further claims from the same source were **rejected** because our versions are stricter — `verification-evidence` already carries the four evidence-validity rules with eight worked instances, and `class-level-fix` already requires the negative control to be run **per sub-set** and to **name** the offending member, which the source does not.
  - **`verification-evidence` 1.2.0 → 1.3.0 — VE-011, evidence freshness.** Every number in an evidence record must come from **one fresh run executed after the last edit to the artefact it verifies**; results from mid-task runs are stale and must not be reported. VE-001 through VE-010 all govern how a result is *interpreted*; none governed *when it was produced*. The failure this closes is a green suite followed by an edit to a prompt or a config, followed by a commit — the suite that passed was the one before the last change, and the guard that catches it is precisely the one pinning content hashes, which type-checking and linting never wake.
  - **`test-governance` 1.1.0 → 1.2.0 — threshold gates must fail closed.** A measurement layer that prints a percentage and exits `0` regardless of whether the number cleared its threshold is a report, not a gate: it stays green while the number drifts downward and nothing stops the next merge. Enforcement must come from the tool's own flag (`--cov-fail-under`, `diff-cover --fail-under`, `nyc --check-coverage`) rather than a wrapper re-parsing printed output. Placed here rather than in `verification-evidence` because this standard governs **how a check is built**, while that one governs **how an exit code is read** once it exists; the two now cross-reference.
  - **`mutation-testing` 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 — kill attribution, one-sided invariants, equivalent mutants.** `Killed` means *some* test failed; tools do not record which, and none records which **level**. A 7/7 score therefore verifies the whole suite that ran, not the property suite inside it — so "the properties verify X" requires re-running the mutants against the property suite alone. A one-sided invariant ("never exceeds the limit") **cannot** detect a fail-closed mutant, because rejecting everything never produces an over-limit output; every one-sided property now needs its opposite boundary. And a surviving mutant is not automatically a gap — semantically equivalent mutants must be classified with a reason rather than killed by an assertion that exists only to move the number.
  - **`class-level-fix` 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 — what a passing negative control does not prove.** A control that passes once demonstrates that **one** known-bad case reaches the checker's failure path. It does **not** demonstrate that the checker recognises **every** violation of the rule it purports to guard. A grep-based gate can fail closed perfectly while guarding a spelling rather than a behaviour: the synthetic member proves the wire is connected, not that the net is wide enough.
  - **VE-012 / CLF-008 — a narrow gate must be registered, not merely disclosed.** Where a check's actual coverage is narrower than the rule it serves, saying so is necessary and not sufficient: **disclosure alone does not satisfy the rule**, because writing "this check does not cover everything" is far cheaper than widening coverage, so every narrow gate would grow an honest paragraph and stay narrow. The gap must carry a dated entry in an exception inventory with a review date. This is the repository's own recurring failure — a hash scan that took 115 files and emitted 2, a reference checker skipping an entire shipped directory, an index gate firing only on a date stamp — each one a gate narrower than its rule with nothing saying so.

### Changed

- **`model-selection` 1.0.1 → 2.1.0 — one axis became two** (XSPEC-362). The standard decided model tier from **how many files a task changes**. A 3-file redesign of module boundaries is harder than an 8-file mechanical rename, so that signal mis-sorted "deep and narrow" work **in a fixed direction** — a bias, not noise. It survived because it is cheap to measure, not because it predicts anything. Replaced by two criteria: **reasoning-ceiling requirement** (is there a component more thinking time cannot solve?) and **specification definiteness**, which is explicitly **bidirectional** — handing an ambiguous task to a literal-following model yields "precisely executed the wrong sentence", and feeding a written-out step list to a high-ceiling model *lowers* output quality. Tier ids (`fast` / `standard` / `capable`) are unchanged; only the criteria moved.
  - **New effort axis, orthogonal to the model axis.** Depth-of-thinking is now a **parameter of one dispatch**, not a property of a model: vendor-neutral levels `low` / `medium` / `high` / `very-high` / `max`, mapped locally by each platform. The standard states plainly which failure gets which remedy — output shallow but sound is **depth insufficient** (raise effort on the same model), output wrong in kind *at max effort* is **ceiling insufficient** (escalate the tier) — and that the two are not interchangeable. Escalating a tier without exhausting effort is an untested assumption about which axis was short.
  - **New reverse-exclusion section.** The old standard only said what work to *raise* to a tier, never what not to *send* to one. **Hard boundaries** (context capacity, effort-parameter support, modality) are the absence of a capability, not a lower degree of it, and must be excluded **before** cost comparison — excluding them afterwards lets a cheaper, incapable model win on price. **Reverse risks**: a high-capability tier may decline specification-sensitive work via a safety classifier, and **the refusal is not an error** — it arrives as a normal response carrying a refusal marker. For a caller checking only the exit code or only whether an exception was raised, that is a **silent failure**: the pipeline records success and the work was never done. Callers must now inspect for the marker.
  - **`capability_dimensions` sub-dimensions split into `declared` and `measured`.** One 1–5 score was carrying two different facts: *can it do this at all* (binary, vendor-declared, free at connection time) and *how well* (continuous, needs a benchmark). Merged, the cheap fact and the expensive one become indistinguishable. `declared: false` is now a hard boundary; `declared: true` with `measured` absent is `UNKNOWN`. Deriving `supported` from a score is prohibited, and a **failed measurement must not be recorded as a score** — including `0`, which is not on the 1–5 scale, and which makes "we could not measure it" look exactly like "we measured it and it was bad".
  - **`routing_rules` extended from three states to four.** `UNSUPPORTED` previously meant "score ≤ 1 **or unregistered**", collapsing "measured and unreliable" with "never measured". The consequence is that a newly detected model is excluded on first evaluation and never re-enters the pool — the opposite of supporting more models. `UNKNOWN` is now a distinct state that **queues for calibration**, and the two must be distinguishable **in the return structure**, not merely in logs: a caller has to tell "this model cannot do it" from "I do not yet know", because they lead to different next actions.
  - **Re-measurement now has three independent triggers**: version-identifier change, `measured.at` older than 90 days, and a degradation-detection alert (DEC-033). Version change is a **sufficient** condition, not a necessary one — DEC-033 exists precisely because behaviour changes while the version string does not, so an implementation keyed only to version change misses the entire scenario it was built to catch.
  - **Section versions removed** (R6a). The file carried a whole-file version `1.0.1` *and* a section marked `2.0.0`, with no rule saying which the `.ai.yaml` `meta.version` tracked — so "the versions are in sync" was not a checkable claim. There is now one version field, and the rule stating that `.ai.yaml` tracks it is written in the standard. The 2026-04-13 addition of the capability-management section — which had **never been entered in the version history at all** — is now recorded there.

### Added

- **`check-model-pin-freshness` — a clock for `capability_registry`** (XSPEC-362 R4). DEC-031 D1 required `pin_date` to be *recorded*; nothing ever required it to be *read*. The shipped example sat **120 days past its own 90-day threshold**, and on the page an expired entry was indistinguishable from a current one. The check reports two kinds of rot: dates older than the threshold, and **concrete vendor model IDs in shipped examples** — a model ID written into a standard is a citation with an expiry date and no owner, so examples now use placeholders. It is **WARN, never BLOCK**, per XSPEC-361 R8's measured false-positive rate for in-file invariants; only a scan that did not complete exits non-zero, because "the checker broke" and "the checker found nothing" must not produce the same output. It walks the shipped trees rather than a typed list of standards, and prints its denominator and exclusions. `--self-test` runs both predicates against fixtures with known verdicts, because a checker that scans 366 files and reports nothing looks exactly like one whose predicates never fire. Wired into `pre-release-check.sh` step 18.8, which prints its warnings rather than swallowing them — `run_check` hides the output of anything exiting 0, and this check exits 0 by design.
- **Claude Code host-layer mapping for `model-selection`** (XSPEC-362 R5): `integrations/claude-code/model-selection-mapping.md` and its machine-readable twin, four reference subagent definitions under `integrations/claude-code/.claude/agents/`, and a cross-repository dispatch template. The standard is vendor-neutral **by rule** — it defines `fast` / `standard` / `capable` and `low` … `max` as labels and states that it cannot say which effort levels a given model accepts, leaving those cells marked `?`. This directory answers them for one host, and is the only place in the repository where concrete model identifiers belong. `core/` is unchanged and still carries **zero** concrete model IDs.
  - **The mapping exists because the names do not line up.** UDS `very-high` is spelled `xhigh` in Claude Code — the single renamed level. The standard is not bent to match the tool; the rename is absorbed at the host layer, which is what R5 is for.
  - **The `fast` tier has no effort axis on this host**, because its model accepts no effort level at all. That is a hard boundary with a consequence for the standard's own rules: **MS-005** ("raise effort on the same model") **cannot be executed there**, and reaching for MS-001 instead does not violate the ordering rule — the effort set at that tier is empty from the start. A grid whose cells were `?` in the standard is now resolved, per provider.
  - **Hard boundaries are registered as `declared`, not as scores**, per R7b, and `measured` is absent throughout because no benchmark was run — recorded as `UNKNOWN`, never filled with a default. The register also names two boundaries that are invisible in an agent file: the same alias resolves to different models per provider (on some, `effort` is silently inert), and a background subagent — the default since v2.1.198 — silently loses built-in tools outside a fixed set, reporting no error.
  - **R3b is quoted from the vendor, not asserted.** The host's own documentation says its highest-capability model triggers automatic fallback when safety classifiers fire, and that the way to get good output from it is to "describe the outcome, not the steps" — R3b #1 and #2 respectively, stated from the other side.
  - **The dispatch template's rationale was measured, and it corrects a claim this repository was shipping.** `agent-dispatch.ai.yaml` said subagents do not load the target project's instructions and cannot invoke its skills. Both halves are false: subagents load the CLAUDE.md hierarchy and can invoke skills. The real constraint is narrower and easier to miss — **they load the hierarchy of the main session's working directory, not of the repository they are being sent to work on.** Measured 2026-08-12 by dispatching a tool-denied subagent and asking it, before it was allowed to run `pwd`, which CLAUDE.md files were in its context: exactly two, neither of them the target's. Same-repository dispatch needs no template; cross-repository dispatch has no other source of rules. The note is corrected in place, with the measurement and with an explicit warning against deleting the mechanism after reading the vendor docs.
  - **`check-model-pin-freshness` now walks `integrations/` too.** Its `VENDOR` predicate is suppressed there — concrete IDs are the *required* form in a host mapping — while `STALE` still applies, which is the entire reason for scanning the tree: the argument that a model ID is "a citation with an expiry date and no clock" does not stop being true because the ID moved to a legitimate home. Suppressed hits are counted into `skipped` rather than dropped, so the carve-out stays in the denominator, and `--self-test` gains cases in **both** directions — a suppression tested only in the direction it suppresses is indistinguishable from one that swallowed everything.
- **`agent-dispatch` machine-readable standard reinstated** (XSPEC-362 R5a): `ai/standards/agent-dispatch.ai.yaml`, the self-adoption copy, and registry + manifest entries. `core/agent-dispatch.md` has shipped in the npm bundle continuously, but the `.ai.yaml` was removed in 6.0.0 (XSPEC-086 Phase 2 / DEC-049) on the premise that `dev-autopilot` owned the canonical machine-readable copy. **That owner entered maintenance mode on 2026-04-28** — the day after the migration landed — and the removal proceeded anyway two months later. Adopters installing with `--format ai` have since received the prose in the bundle and the rules nowhere. `agent-dispatch` is removed from the `REFERENCE_ONLY` lists in all four checker scripts that carry one; the other seven standards from that batch remain reference-only and are **not** addressed here.
  - Responsibility boundary, so the two standards do not grow duplicate copies of the same rules: `agent-dispatch` covers **how to dispatch** (parallel safety, independent domains, status protocol, prompt design); `model-selection` covers **who to dispatch to and how deeply**. They cross-reference rather than restate.

## [6.4.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- **`class-level-fix` standard — aim a fix at the set, not the member.** A defect is rarely alone: it is one flag in a dispatch chain, one entry in a manifest, one directory under `agents/`. Fixing the member you were shown leaves the rest of the set exactly as it was, and nothing announces the next one — it returns months later as a fresh incident, which is why this kind of work feels endless. The rule: before fixing, name the enumerable set the defect belongs to and add a check that **walks** that set. The third question is the one that decides whether the check survives — where does the walk read its members from? It has to be the source the system itself reads (the CLI definition, the directory, the manifest), never a list someone typed, because a typed list is correct until the fourth member arrives and nothing will say so. Enumerating fails silently; walking with an exclusion list fails loudly, because an exclusion has to be written down by a person who has to justify it. The check must print its denominator **and what it excluded** — "checked 4,012 declarations" reads like coverage while the filter silently skipped every directory entry. And it must be proven non-vacuous per sub-set before it is trusted, because a check over five lists that was only ever tested against the first is a check over one list.

  Every example in the standard was measured on 2026-08-10. The one that carries it is the counter-example: this repository had already fixed exactly this defect for `--integrations-only` eleven days earlier, **with a comment explaining the general problem**, and left the other three branches untouched. The knowledge was in the file; it had not reached its siblings. A comment describing the class is not a check over the class.

  The standard states plainly that **it has no automated gate** — nothing can walk "every defect being fixed right now" — and records why, what enforces it (review, with one question: *what set is this a member of?*), and what would make a gate possible. Omitting that would have made it the next instance of the thing it was written to prevent.

### Fixed

- **`--plan` and `--apply` scope behaviour now reaches `--help`.** 6.3.10 documented the new combined behaviour by editing `docs/reference/FEATURE-REFERENCE.md` — a generated file. The edit survived exactly as long as nobody regenerated it. The text now lives in the `.option()` strings in `cli/bin/uds.js`, so it appears in `uds update --help` as well, which the hand-edited copy never did.

## [6.3.10] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **`--plan` was dropped by four other flags, and the one that prevents damage is the one that got ignored.** `uds update --plan --skills` installed Skills; `--plan --sync-refs` rewrote integration files and the manifest. The flag documented as "Show reconciliation plan without executing (like terraform plan)" was silently discarded, because scope flags (`--skills`, `--commands`, `--integrations-only`, `--sync-refs`) sat ahead of mode flags (`--plan`, `--apply`, `--force`, `--rollback`) in one first-match-wins chain where every branch returns. `--integrations-only` had already been fixed on 2026-07-30 for exactly this; the other three were left, and eleven days later they were still writing. Mode is now decided before scope, and a test enumerates the flag list from the CLI definition rather than from a hand-written list — a flag added later is covered without anybody remembering to add it. That test is what found the fourth instance.
- **`--apply --skills` upgraded Skills and silently left the standards behind, reporting success.** Same chain: `--skills` returned before the reconciler ever ran. Upgrading a real project this way left it on the previous standards version with nothing on screen saying so. `--apply` and `--force` now do the reconciliation *and* the requested scope.
- **A confirmation prompt with nobody to answer it exited 0.** In a non-interactive shell `@inquirer/prompts` throws `ExitPromptError`; the exception was never caught and the process still ended with exit code 0 — so in CI "wrote nothing" and "updated successfully" returned the same value. It now explains that nothing was written, points at `--yes`, and exits 2. Detection is by the prompt actually failing rather than by probing `process.stdin.isTTY`, which is wrong in both directions.
- **`--rollback` now says that `--skills`/`--commands` cannot narrow it**, instead of accepting them and restoring everything anyway.

## [6.3.9] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- **The standards index announced a number the sync check disagreed with, and both were describing the same manifest.** 6.3.8 taught the check to resolve manifest entries through the registry; the index block kept announcing `installedStandards.length` straight off the manifest. On a real project that is 78 against 70, and the difference is the eight machine-readable standards `MIGRATION-v6` §2 removed in 6.0.0, still declared in manifests two majors later because `uds update` does not prune them. Seventy-eight was the wrong number irrespective of the check: it sat directly above "the authoritative list is the `standards` field of `.standards/manifest.json`" — pointing the reader at the source of the discrepancy as though that settled it — and it told an agent to expect eight files that are not there. The block now counts entries that resolve to a file and names the rest underneath, with a line saying why they linger, so both numbers appear and neither has to be inferred.

## [6.3.8] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- **`uds deps` printed a green tick over a set it had not examined.** Run against a project with no runtime dependencies and a pnpm lockfile, it reported `0 runtime dependencies checked`, then `no package-lock.json — nothing to compare the registry against`, then `✓ every dependency resolves to the version you test against`, and exited 0. Both facts were true; together they claimed a repository this command cannot read had been checked and was fine, and a gate wired to that exit code agrees. `clean` was the conjunction of three empty lists, which holds vacuously over an empty set — and the test covering it asserted exactly that, on the reasoning that the denominator travels with the verdict. It did travel, and it changed nothing: the tick came straight after it and the exit code carried no trace of the count. **Printing the denominator does not stop an empty set reading as reassurance; refusing the verdict does.** Also fixed the second half of that message: the project has a perfectly good `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and being told it has no lockfile is how a reader decides the tool is confused and stops reading it. The command now names the lockfile it found and says which format it reads.
- **A registry ID is not a filename, and eight places treated it as one.** A manifest's `standards` array is mixed by design: core standards became registry IDs in v3.4.0, option entries stay as their upstream source path because options have no ID. Every consumer ran `basename()` over both — correct for a path, a no-op for an ID. `error-code-standards` installs as `error-codes.ai.yaml`, `logging-standards` as `logging.ai.yaml`, `ai-agreement` as `ai-agreement-standards.ai.yaml`; most IDs do equal their basename, which is why this survived. Three failures came out of the one mistake: minimal mode printed `.standards/<id>`, leaving **seven of seventy paths in a real adopter's AGENTS.md pointing at nothing**, directly beneath a line reading "you MUST read and follow the standards in `.standards/`"; the index block filtered by an `.ai.yaml` suffix, which no ID carries, so **every core standard was dropped** and the same adopter's earlier block listed seven options and none of its sixty-three core standards; and the task-mapping table is keyed by filename, so an ID matched nothing and the standard quietly got no mapping. Resolution is now one exported function used by all eight call sites, and entries it cannot resolve are reported under the list rather than printed as paths.
- **The check that exists to catch exactly that drift had the same defect.** `AGENTS.md Standards Sync` reported `7/7` against a manifest of seventy: the `.ai.yaml` filter left only the seven option entries, all seven were present, so it ticked — before the upgrade when sixty-three standards were missing from the block, and after, with seven dead paths in it. Blind to ninety percent of what it measured, and green throughout. Now 67 of 67 on the same project, and breaking one path by hand reports 66/67 and names the file. The mapping it needed was already built a hundred and seventy lines above it, with a comment naming the exact case.
- **The generator still wrote a path removed in 6.0.0 into adopters' instruction files.** `MIGRATION-v6` §2 removed eight machine-readable standards whose runtime moved to the adoption layer; three `Reference:` lines and a MUST-priority task mapping kept pointing at `.standards/workflow-enforcement.ai.yaml`. The human-readable `core/workflow-enforcement.md` was deliberately kept upstream, but adopters receive `.standards/`, not `core/`, so it is not a substitute path — the lines are gone rather than redirected. The condition gating that section matched a filename no manifest has held since 3.4.0, so it had quietly stopped firing for the two projects that still declare the standard; both forms now match.

## [6.3.7] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **`uds deps` read only the root manifest, so a monorepo got a clean answer about part of itself.** npm workspaces put declarations in more than one `package.json`, and this command examined one of them. Measured on a real project: 34 dependencies reported, 47 declared — the 13 in a workspace were invisible, and among them a package carrying a high-severity advisory. **A count without its scope cannot be told apart from a complete one**, which is the failure this command exists to report. Workspaces are now expanded from the `workspaces` field, every manifest is examined, and the report prints which workspaces were included so the denominator carries its own scope. Each drift row names the workspace it came from — otherwise a reader knows a package drifted but not which `package.json` to edit.
- Three details that make the difference between covering workspaces and appearing to. A lockfile entry may be hoisted to the root **or** nested under the workspace, so both are tried; checking one reports the other as "not present in package-lock.json", and a fabricated unknown reads as a finding. A workspace depending on a sibling workspace is a file link, not a published package, so it is skipped rather than queried — asking npm returns 404 and would be recorded as unverifiable. And a `workspaces` pattern more complex than a trailing `*` in the last segment now **fails loudly** instead of matching a subset: silently covering less than the author meant is the same defect in a new place.

## [6.3.6] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **6.3.5 said the shipped standards all parsed. It had counted 141 of 287.** The gate added in 6.3.5 named three directories explicitly and did not recurse, so `ai/options/`, `locales/` and `skills/` — all of which `prepack` bundles into the tarball — sat outside its denominator. Ten files in those directories still failed to parse after 6.3.5 shipped, in both Chinese locales and in `skills/`. **A gate that enumerates its own scope goes stale the moment a directory is added**, so it now walks the repo and checks every `.ai.yaml` outside build and vendor paths — 759 files here, against the 423 it previously claimed as complete.
- **Eight more files parsed and were wrong, which no parses-or-not check can see.** `{UT:70%,IT:20%}` is not a mapping: without a space after the colon, YAML reads a single plain scalar key `UT:70%` whose value is null. An unquoted `- git commit -m "feat: add model"` becomes `{'git commit -m "feat': 'add model"'}`. These pass every syntax check while handing an agent nonsense. The gate now also rejects keys carrying a quote character or a colon with no space after it — the fingerprint of a scalar silently read as a mapping — and both branches are covered by a control test rather than assumed.

## [6.3.5] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **Four shipped `.ai.yaml` standards did not parse.** 6.3.4 delivered 141 machine-readable standards, of which `agent-behavior-discipline`, `container-security`, `full-coverage-testing` and `knowledge-graph-memory` were syntactically invalid YAML. The same four sat in `.standards/`, which is what `uds init` puts in an adopter's directory. An agent reading them gets an exception, not empty content — and a downstream that catches it gets a silence indistinguishable from "this standard has no rules". All four failed the same way: an unquoted scalar carrying YAML-significant characters — a colon inside parentheses, a flow sequence followed by prose, a quote closing mid-value, a key indented differently from its siblings. Fixed by quoting or re-indenting, with no restructuring.

### Added

- **`npm run check:ai-yaml` — every `.ai.yaml` must parse, and the check is wired into pre-commit and the release.** The four above reached a release because eight scripts read that directory and not one parsed the whole set; `check-standards-sync.sh` compares versions and registry entries, which an unparseable file passes without complaint. The check reads `ai/`, `.standards/` and `cli/bundled/`, and runs unconditionally rather than behind a path glob — a glob narrow enough to have skipped this one is the same mistake relocated. **Exit 2 is reserved for "the check could not run"**: an unreadable directory, a directory containing no `.ai.yaml`, a missing YAML library. That is not a pass, and it fails the release, because a check whose "nothing wrong" and "could not look" produce the same output converts an unknown into a reassurance.

## [6.3.4] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **`uds deps` named the version npm would not install.** The resolved column was computed as the highest published version satisfying the declared range. That is semver's rule, not npm's: `npm-pick-manifest` prefers the `latest` dist-tag whenever it satisfies, precisely so a `next` or `beta` publish carrying an ordinary version number does not land on people who asked for a caret. Measured on `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, which publishes `latest = 0.3.223` and `next = 0.3.224`: the command reported 0.3.224 while `npm install …@^0.3` installs 0.3.223. The one column whose entire purpose is to say what an install receives was naming something no install receives. Versions and dist-tags are now read in a single `npm view` call and npm's own preference is applied, falling back to the maximum inside the range when `latest` sits outside it — a project pinned to an older major still gets a truthful answer. Two tests cover both branches.
- The previous two releases corrected this command's wording. This one corrects its arithmetic, and it is worth saying plainly: the earlier fixes made a wrong number easier to read.

## [6.3.3] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **6.3.2 corrected the explanation and left the heading above it asserting what the explanation had just withdrawn.** The drift section was headed `N shipped ≠ tested` — in yellow, one line above the dim paragraph explaining that whether shipped differs from tested depends on how the project ships. For an artifact that carries its own lockfile, shipped *is* tested, so the heading stated the opposite of the truth in the most prominent line of the report. This is precisely the shape 1.1.0 rewrote the Lock Strategy entry to stop producing: a misleading line with a qualification underneath it. The heading now names the two columns that disagree — `N tested ≠ resolves` — which is a statement about the measurement rather than a conclusion about who received it. A test holds it.
- **Two more places said the same thing, including the first one an adopter reads.** `uds deps --help` described the command as "Compare what you test against what your users install (published packages ship no lockfile)", and the module's own summary line asked "does what you test match what your users install?". Both now speak in terms of what the declared ranges resolve to. Found by grepping the repository for the withdrawn wording after fixing the heading — the two instances my own pass had missed.

## [6.3.2] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **`uds deps` asserted a distribution channel it cannot know.** The report ended with "consumers resolve the range themselves, because a published package does not ship a lockfile", and labelled the third column `users get=`. Both are false for a product distributed as a container image built with `npm ci` — its users get the `tested=` column exactly, and the resolved column is instead what the next lockfile regeneration will pull in, unreviewed. Found by running the command against a closed-source product that ships a Docker image and does not publish to npm at all. The column is now `resolves=` and the report states both readings, because a row read on its own must not say the opposite of the truth. This is the same correction 1.1.0 made to the Lock Strategy entry — appending a "but note…" under a misleading line leaves the line misleading, and a report, like a standards table, is mostly read one line at a time. Three tests now hold the wording in place; nothing did before.

## [6.3.1] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **6.3.0 never reached npm — and this release exists because of the same failure it describes.** The release ran, its clean-room job failed at `npm ci` with `EUSAGE … Missing: @emnapi/core@1.11.3 from lock file`, and `Publish to npm` was skipped. The lock file had been regenerated by `npm install --save semver`, which dropped transitive entries that `npm ci` requires; the check I ran locally accepted it, so the disagreement only became visible in the release job — after the tag and the GitHub Release were already public. Rebuilt from the last lock file whose `npm ci` demonstrably passes, adding the semver entry alone, and verified across the CI matrix rather than on one machine.
- **`v6.3.0` is left in place, not deleted, and its release notes now state it was never published.** A tag with no npm counterpart is exactly the mismatch `uds deps` was written to catch; deleting it would remove the evidence rather than the discrepancy. **6.3.1 carries the entire content of 6.3.0**, listed below.

## [6.3.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- **`uds deps` — does what you test match what your users install?** A published package does not carry its lockfile: your CI tests the versions `package-lock.json` pins, your users get whatever the declared ranges resolve to at their install time. When those differ, the whole suite is green about a combination nobody installs, and that green is indistinguishable from a real one. The command compares all three numbers per runtime dependency and reports **only the differences**, with the denominator alongside — a table of agreeing rows gets skimmed, and so do the two that mattered.
  - **Native dependencies are held to a stricter rule.** A package with a native binding is flagged when it is declared with a range, **whether or not it is currently drifting**. semver makes no promise about native ABI compatibility, and this ecosystem has broken it inside a minor range. A range matching exactly one published version is safe because upstream has not published again, not because anything guarantees it — waiting for drift means waiting until your users already have it.
  - **A lookup that fails is never reported as agreement.** It becomes `unverifiable` and fails the run. A check whose "everything is fine" and "I could not find out" look the same converts an unknown into a reassurance.
  - `--path`, `--json`, `--concurrency`.

### Changed

- **`supply-chain-security-standards` 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 — the Lock Strategy entry was correct and incomplete.** It said "use lock files, always committed to Git", which reads as complete and gave nobody following it a reason to look further — while a committed lock file constrains *your* build and reaches none of your users. Rewritten in place rather than annotated with a caveat, because a "but note…" appended under an unchanged rule leaves the original line misleading to anyone who reads only that line, and a standards table is mostly read one line at a time. The new section states the failure with the case that produced it, adds four requirements for projects that publish, and scopes itself explicitly to published artifacts — a deployed service ships its lock file with it and is unaffected.

### Notes

- The standard's `.ai.yaml` remains a five-line stub with no machine-readable rules — **one of four out of 141**, alongside `design-document-standards`, `estimation-standards` and `privacy-standards`, so an agent reading the `ai/` layer gets nothing for any of them. This release deliberately did not add its one new rule there: a single rule in an otherwise empty file makes coverage look better than it is. The gap is now recorded inside the file.

## [6.2.8] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- **Downloaded standards had their Chinese corrupted.** The HTTPS response was accumulated with `data += chunk`, which decodes each chunk on its own — so any character whose bytes straddled a chunk boundary became replacement characters (`日期` → `日�期`). One-byte Latin text was unaffected; three-byte CJK was not. Nothing failed along the way: the transfer completed, the file was written, the action reported success, and the damage was visible only by reading the text. Measured across one machine, **11 projects carried ~278 replacement characters** in their installed standards. The damage concentrates in `requirement-checklist.md`, `requirement-template.md`, `requirement-document-template.md` and locale packs — the files the published package does not ship (`files` carries no `templates/` or `extensions/`), so they can only arrive by download. **If your standards contain `�`, run `uds update --force` on 6.2.8 or later — the re-downloaded content is correct and replaces them.**

## [6.2.7] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- **The reconciler could not fetch extensions from any npm install.** Entries in `manifest.extensions` (locale packs and the like) reached the executor with no resolved source path, because the published package's `files` list carries no `extensions/` directory — so `uds update --force` failed them with `No source path available` while plain `uds update` refreshed the very same file. The executor now resolves extensions through `copyStandard`, the bundled → repo → download fallback it already used for registry entries and the one the legacy path had been using all along. Entries with no source of any kind still fail, as they should.

## [6.2.6] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- **`uds update --apply`** — applies exactly the plan `uds update --plan` prints.

### Fixed

- **`--plan` told you to run a command that ignores the plan.** It printed "Run `uds update` to apply these changes", but plain `uds update` never reaches the reconciler — it runs the legacy path, refreshes existing standards, and reports success for that. On one upgrade it printed `✓ 69 standards updated` while all 8 deletions and 2 creations in the plan above were skipped; the files were still on disk afterwards. Nothing failed, so the output was indistinguishable from having applied the plan. `--force` was not the answer either: it recomputes with `force: true`, a larger plan that rewrites every managed file. **If you have been running `uds update` after reading a plan, the plan's deletions and creations were never applied** — run `uds update --plan` again to see what is still outstanding.

## [6.2.5] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- **`uds update`'s backup directory could be committed to your repository.** `.uds-backup-<timestamp>/` is written beside the project so a reconciliation can be rolled back, and nothing ignored it — so a `git add -A` swept it in. It happened twice in our own repos, once taking 360 files and 73,992 lines into a public one. The backup now ignores itself, via a `.gitignore` containing `*` written inside the directory at creation: `git status` and `git add -A` no longer see it, and **your** `.gitignore` is not modified. Existing backups from earlier versions are not retroactively hidden — delete them or add the rule yourself.

## [6.2.4] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- **`uds update` proposed deleting skills you wrote yourself.** Provenance treated a skill as UDS's own if `manifest.skillHashes` recorded any file under it. That was safe only while the hasher was broken — it held 2 entries for 78 installed skills. Fixing the hasher in 6.2.2 filled the same map with all 137 files under the skills folder, including hand-written ones; each then fell outside a desired state built from what UDS ships and diffed as an orphan to remove. One project's plan proposed deleting 18 directories, 14 of them its own ops skills. Provenance is now a single signal: the name exists in UDS's own `skills/` tree. Skills UDS has since removed are warned about rather than deleted — nothing on disk distinguishes them from your own work, and leaving a stale directory with a warning is a better way to fail than deleting a file somebody hand-wrote. **If you are on 6.2.2 or 6.2.3 and keep your own skills alongside UDS's, run `uds update --plan` before applying anything.**

## [6.2.3] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- **Re-selecting an already-installed agent appended a duplicate manifest entry.** Four manifest writers appended installations with `[...existing, ...new]`, so an agent already on record gained a second entry every time it was re-selected; one project's manifest read `['claude-code', 'claude-code']`. The installer itself was never affected — `installSkillsToMultipleAgents` deduplicates its input. The damage was confined to the *record* and to every consumer that iterates it: `checkNewFeatures` and the reconciler's scanner and desired-state calculator each walked the agent twice. Harmless in effect, which is precisely why it accumulated unnoticed across five upgrades. The four writers now use the same helper the installer already relied on.

## [6.2.2] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- **`uds check` was reporting skill integrity over a fraction of your files.** On one project it printed `✓ All skill files intact (6 files)` with **345** installed. `scanDirectory` derived relative paths with `fullPath.slice(basePath.length + 1)`, which assumes the base path carries no trailing separator — and three agent skill paths do (`.claude/skills/`, `.opencode/skill/`, `.cursor/skills/`). Every entry therefore lost its first character (`ac-coverage` → `c-coverage`, `.manifest.json` → `manifest.json`); `computeDirectoryHashes` rebuilt an absolute path from the mangled name, found no file, and skipped the entry. 115 files scanned, 2 hashed. Nothing failed along the way — the directory existed, the loop completed, the function returned an object, and the check printed a green tick over 2% of the surface. `manifest.skillHashes` is now populated correctly; the same project reports 345.


## [6.2.1] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- **`uds update --locale <x> --skills` now records which locale it installed.** `manifest.skills.locale` was written once by `init` and by no other path — the same stale-by-design shape 6.2.0 stopped trusting for `skills.names`. Switching a project's skills to a localized variant swapped every file on disk and left the field untouched. That field became load-bearing in 6.2.0, whose locale fix reads `skills.locale` first and falls back to `display_language`: where the two disagree — a project whose display language is English but whose skills were installed with `--locale zh-tw` — the next reconcile would quietly put them all back to English. Exactly the defect 6.2.0 fixed, re-entering through the other door. All five skill-install paths now record the locale they installed.


## [6.2.0] - 2026-07-31

> **The reconciler was deleting things it did not install, and reporting success afterwards.** `uds update --plan` proposed removing 86 files from one adopter repo; 72 of them were skills, commands and option files that UDS ships and the project uses. Twelve defects, all of one shape: a well-formed name that simply never matches, so nothing errors and the plan looks authoritative. If you have ever looked at a `--plan` output and wondered why it wanted to delete your work — it was not you.

### Added

- **The standards index in `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` now states a count and points at the manifest** instead of listing every standard by name (XSPEC-358 R1). The enumerated list cost roughly 2 KB of always-loaded context per project and duplicated `.standards/manifest.json`, which is authoritative and never out of date. The block regenerates itself on the next `uds update`; no action is needed. **If you have tooling that parses the enumeration, read `manifest.standards` instead.**

### Fixed

- **The reconciler no longer deletes skills you wrote yourself.** `isUDSManaged` returned true for every directory under the skills folder, so anything not shipped by the running UDS version was proposed for removal. One adopter's plan listed fourteen hand-written ops skills for deletion. Provenance is now established from UDS's own `skills/` tree — which also covers the non-skill siblings (`_shared`, `agents`, `ai`, `tools`, `workflows`) that an older CLI copied in by mistake, so those remain cleanable — or from a recorded hash. Anything else is warned about, not removed. The deliberate cost: four skills UDS has since retired are now warned about rather than deleted, because nothing on disk distinguishes them from your own work.
- **`manifest.skills.names` and `commands.names` are no longer treated as the desired state.** Both were written once by `init` and by no other code path. One repo's list stayed frozen at 32 skills across nine commits and five UDS upgrades while the shipped set grew to 55, so 40 usable skills diffed as "no longer in desired state". The desired set is now what the running UDS version ships, which is what `uds update` actually installs. All 18 install sites now keep the lists truthful as well.
- **Gemini CLI commands are no longer proposed for deletion.** The scanner stripped a hard-coded `.md`; Gemini installs commands as `.toml`, so its keys stayed `commit.toml` and never matched the desired key `commit`. All 30 of them diffed as orphans. The extension now comes from the agent config, shared with the installer that writes those files.
- **UDS no longer proposes deleting its own installation record.** `.manifest.json`, written by the command installer, was counted as a stray command.
- **Selected options are no longer proposed for deletion.** `calculateOptions` iterated `manifest.options` as if its keys were standard ids, found no standard named `workflow`, and skipped — producing an empty desired option set for every project. One repo's plan proposed deleting all seven options its own manifest names. The manifest-key to registry-category mapping now lives in one table both the installer and the calculator read.
- **Locale packs and other extensions are no longer proposed for deletion.** `manifest.extensions` had no branch in the reconciler at all, so every installed extension — locale packs, language style guides, framework patterns — fell outside the desired state while the manifest went on listing it as installed.
- **A reconcile no longer reinstalls every skill in English.** The skill install path omitted the locale argument that the command path passed, silently replacing localized skills with their canonical English variants while `skills.locale` went on recording the original.
- **A successful reconcile now records the version it reconciled to.** `upstream.version` was never advanced, so `uds check` still reported the project as behind and any staleness monitor reading that field kept flagging it.
- **A rewritten integration block no longer reports itself as modified.** `migrate_block` refreshed `integrationBlockHashes` but not `fileHashes`, which is what File Integrity compares.
- **The reconciler and `uds update` now generate the same integration block.** Two independent builders had drifted: the reconciler's omitted the content categories entirely, so reconciling a project silently dropped its commit-message section; it also defaulted the output language to English regardless of `options.output_language`, and looked up `integrationConfigs` by tool key when the manifest stores it by file name.
- **Option files are counted correctly in the index block.** They were counted from `manifest.standards`, which records them inconsistently — one repo reported "0 options" with seven of them installed.
- **`uds check` no longer reports a false out-of-sync on the new index block.** Two checks asserted the retired enumeration by grepping for every standard name, so after upgrading they reported `5/70` and `0/7` and advised running `uds update` — which regenerates the same block. Both now verify the declared count against the manifest, which also catches a stale count the name grep never could.
- **`manifest.integrations` is read tolerantly in both shapes.** It has been written as tool keys by one path and as file paths by another; 20 of 21 measured repos stored file paths, and the reconciler understood only tool keys — so it proposed stripping the UDS block from `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` in all of them.
- **`uds update --plan --integrations-only` no longer writes files.** The `--integrations-only` branch ran before the `--plan` check.
- **`uds init` no longer installs husky into the UDS source repo** when the test suite runs from the repository root.

### Changed

- **The release gate measures again.** `pre-release-check.sh` invoked `tsx` bare, so on a shell without it on PATH three checks reported "✗ Failed" for a missing binary — indistinguishable from a real finding; it now resolves `tsx` or stops. And its dogfooding gate ran `uds check` without `--force`, which DEC-044's self-adoption guard refuses inside this repo — the gate had failed on every release since it was added in 5.15.1.


## [6.1.1] - 2026-07-18

> **`uds check` was measuring the wrong thing, quietly.** Its staleness check compared your standards against the CLI's own bundled copy instead of npm — so a stale CLI produced a backwards, meaningless message and could never actually say your standards were behind — and it buried that message under one line per unchanged file.

### Fixed

- **`uds check` now compares your installed standards against the latest release on npm, not the CLI's own bundled copy** (XSPEC-342). `displayAdoptionStatus` checked `manifest.upstream.version` against the standards bundled *inside the running CLI*. When the CLI itself was out of date, that bundled copy was older than npm — so the check printed a backwards `⚠ Update available: 6.1.0 → 5.12.1` (telling you to "update" to an *older* version) and structurally could never report that your standards were behind. It now asks npm for the latest version; when your standards trail it, the message reframes to **"Your installed standards are behind the latest release"** and gives the full two-step fix — `npm update -g universal-dev-standards` **and then** `uds update` — because updating only the CLI leaves your project's `.standards/` untouched. `--offline` silently skips the comparison instead of falling back to the misleading bundled check.

### Changed

- **`uds check` no longer lists every unchanged file** (XSPEC-342). It printed one `✓ … (unchanged)` line per tracked file — about 70% of the command's output (measured 121 → 41 lines) — which buried the messages that actually needed reading and made the output large enough that automated callers (pre-commit agents) truncated it. The per-file "unchanged" listing is gone; the count remains in the one-line integrity summary, and modified / missing / unhashed files are still listed individually.

## [6.1.0] - 2026-07-17

> **Two failures of the same shape, one in the standards and one in the CLI**: a check ran, returned, and reported success while measuring nothing. `verification-evidence` gains the layer that names it; `uds init` stops being an instance of it.

### Fixed

- **`uds init` no longer overwrites an existing `prepare` script** (XSPEC-341). Since 2026-02-04, `uds init` shelled out to `npx husky init` on any Node project without a `.husky/` directory. That command is a one-time bootstrap for a *new* project: it sets `"prepare": "husky"` unconditionally. If your project already had a `prepare` — and for a published package, `prepare` is commonly the build step — **it was silently replaced**, and the CLI reported success. `uds init` now chains instead of clobbering (`"tsup"` → `"tsup && husky"`), prints every `package.json` field it modifies, and no longer discards husky's stderr.

  > **⚠️ If you ran `uds init` on a project that already had a `prepare` script, check it now.** This fix protects future runs; it cannot restore a `package.json` that was already rewritten. The symptom is `"prepare": "husky"` where you expected your build command — and if your package publishes built output (`files: ["dist"]`, `main` pointing into `dist/`) with no `prepack`/`prepublishOnly`, your next `npm publish` ships an unbuilt or stale directory. Restore it by chaining: `"prepare": "<your original command> && husky"`.

- **`uds init` no longer seeds `.husky/pre-commit` with `npm test`** (XSPEC-341). That line came from husky's init template, not from UDS — it put a full test-suite gate on every commit that adopters never opted into. UDS now only appends its own `npx uds check`, and appends to existing hooks rather than rewriting them.

- **Fresh husky hooks are written in v9 format** (XSPEC-341). The fallback hook template still emitted the v8 `#!/usr/bin/env sh` + `. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"` preamble, which is deprecated in husky v9 and removed in v10 — while `uds init` installs husky `^9`. This was latent (husky init previously wrote the hook); removing `husky init` promoted the fallback to the primary path, so it was corrected.

### Changed

- **`verification-evidence` 1.1.0 → 1.2.0 — evidence validity** (XSPEC-340). The standard treated `exit_code` as ground truth: `trust_rules` said "`exit_code ≠ 0` → verification failed", `physical_spec.checks` asked "is `exit_code` 0 (success)?", and VE-002 triggered a fix loop on any non-zero. **All three are now qualified**, because a verification command can run, return, and mean nothing:
  - **New `evidence_validity` layer + rules VE-007 – VE-010**: `exit_code = 0` means success only for tools that return 0 on success (VE-007); "empty / not-found / 0" is not absence until the query tool is shown to have executed (VE-008); existence checks must not discard stderr (VE-009); a pipeline's exit code belongs to no single stage (VE-010).
  - **New `non_evidence_claims`**: "Done" / "It should work now" / "I changed the code" / "The tests should pass" / "The command returned 0".
  - Distinct from `anti-hallucination`, whose prohibitions are all forms of "don't assert what you didn't check". This is the opposite failure — **it was checked, and the checking tool silently did not work**. `core/verification-evidence.md` carries eight real instances as evidence.
- **`verification-evidence` human docs caught up with v1.1.0.** The v1.1.0 `environment_layer` work (XSPEC-204) had landed in all three `.ai.yaml` copies and **none of the four `.md` copies** — the human documentation had been describing the standard incorrectly since 2026-05-13. `core/*.md` now documents `environment_layer`, the Environment Layers section, and VE-005 / VE-006.
- **`verification-evidence` gains three sections that previously existed only in the zh-TW translation**: Non-Evidence Claims, Evidence Types, Related Standards. The translation was more complete than its source; the sections are now upstream in English and present in both locales.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-07-06

> ⚠️ **Major release.** Contains one breaking rename and removes 8 deprecated machine-readable standards plus 4 deprecated CLI commands (all carrying a "removed in 6.0.0" notice since 5.4.0). **See the [v6 Migration Guide](docs/MIGRATION-v6.md)** ([繁體中文](locales/zh-TW/docs/MIGRATION-v6.md) | [简体中文](locales/zh-CN/docs/MIGRATION-v6.md)).

### Changed — BREAKING

- **`review` command/skill renamed to `code-review`** (T1). `/review` callers must migrate to `/code-review`; flow-id `review-flow` → `code-review-flow`. See Migration Guide §1.

### Removed — BREAKING (scheduled since 5.4.0)

- **8 deprecated `.ai.yaml` standard stubs removed** (runtime relocated to adoption layer in 5.4.0 per XSPEC-086/095 / DEC-049): `agent-communication-protocol`, `agent-dispatch`, `branch-completion`, `change-batching-standards`, `execution-history`, `pipeline-integration-standards`, `workflow-enforcement`, `workflow-state-protocol`. The human-readable `core/*.md` documents remain as reference (now on the registry-check REFERENCE_ONLY list); registry entries removed. See Migration Guide §2.
- **4 deprecated CLI commands removed**: `uds start` / `uds mission:*`, `uds workflow:*`, `uds flow:*`, `uds sweep` (orchestration is adoption-layer responsibility; `/sweep` skill replaces `uds sweep`). Dead i18n keys and stale in-CLI hints referencing removed commands cleaned up (`config` next-steps, `quickstart` recipes). See Migration Guide §3.

### Added — New standards (coverage-roadmap waves + flagships)

- **Domain & lifecycle standards completed**: product — `prd-standards`, `product-metrics`, `user-story-mapping` (XSPEC-069); infra — `container-image`, `secret-management`, `iac-design` (XSPEC-065); SRE — `incident-response`, `slo-sli`, `runbook` (XSPEC-063); data engineering — `data-pipeline`, `schema-evolution`, `data-contract` (XSPEC-068); compliance — `audit-trail`, `pii-classification` (XSPEC-066).
- **Flagship standards**: `verification-oracle` (XSPEC-256), `model-provenance` (XSPEC-255), `resource-cost-boundary` (XSPEC-277).
- **`user-journey-testing`** shipped as a first-class standard (ai/standards + core + zh-TW + registry).
- **`logging-standards` mandatory events catalog** (XSPEC-234).

### Added — UDS Stage 2 hardening (T5–T16)

- **Canonical AC annotation** (T5) across `acceptance-criteria-traceability` and worked examples.
- **Sourced quantitative thresholds** (T8): `browser-compatibility` 95%/90% gate, `checkin` code-smell, `accessibility` session-timeout, `code-review` PR-size/response-time + bulk exception, `project-context-memory` 7-day staleness, `developer-memory` retirement, `privacy` DPIA "large scale".
- **Failure Handling sections** (T7): `git-worktree` transient-failure retry, `reverse-engineering` escalation, `forward-derivation` recovery.
- **Cross-functional hand-offs** (T16): `security-testing` finding-remediation lifecycle, `pii-classification` discovery & hand-off contract.
- **Glossary terminology normalization** as canonical source of truth (T6).
- **CLI hardening** (T11/T12): Mission `FAILED` terminal state + resume guard, transactional `init` with rollback, input validation for `hitl`/`run`/`release`/config.

### Added — Migration & refactor completeness family

- `migration-assistant` post-cutover data reconciliation (XSPEC-284 P0), state-machine & temporal parity (XSPEC-287); `full-coverage-testing` migration error-path completeness (XSPEC-288); `performance-standards` migration non-functional parity (XSPEC-286).

### Added — Tooling & workflow

- **BQS v1 quality contract for `/brainstorm` v4** (XSPEC-296).
- **CI Job Orchestration Patterns** in the `ci-cd-assistant` skill — trigger separation, shared-resource serialization, change-detection gating, advisory-vs-gating, `npm ci` `EUSAGE` troubleshooting (UDS #126 / XSPEC-300).
- **Pre-deploy attestation verification gate** in `pipeline-security-gates`.
- **Pre-release issue/PR triage gate** in the release flow (XSPEC-265).
- `release verify` now consumes the recorded manifest checksum.
- `/journey-test` and `/skill-builder` registered as formal commands.
- Optional model-tier annotation (R6, XSPEC-270 Work Package A).
- `sync-standard` four-layer sync tool; Phase 2 content-coverage audit metadata.

### Added — Incident-sourced anti-drift & testability

- **`refactoring-standards` Semantic Duplication & Copy-Drift** (#142): names the Copy-Drift anti-pattern (a domain fact re-implemented across sites, or a derived aggregate stored without an enforced binding to its source — invisible to textual-duplication metrics) and the Single-Source-of-Truth / Derive-Don't-Duplicate remedy (one unit per fact, derive over store, recompute stored aggregates at one choke point, lock with golden + architecture tests), plus the migration Intentional-Divergence Registry.
- **`mock-boundary` injectable background execution** (#143): treats in-process fire-and-forget work (`Task.Run`, unawaited promises, `setTimeout`, goroutines, executors) as an injectable seam like the clock — production keeps real fire-and-forget, the test dispatcher runs inline and tracks the task for deterministic completion; adds the Poll/Sleep-for-Background-Result anti-pattern and a no-poll/sleep rule.

### Changed

- **API versioning & deprecation consolidated into single sources of truth** — producer-side API-versioning material folded into `api-design-standards`; inconsistent deprecation timelines reconciled (XSPEC-298 R8).
- **Deployment Version Identity** section added to `versioning` with a build-metadata discriminator caveat (XSPEC-298 R1).
- **`versioning` build identity & polyglot versioning** (XSPEC-298 R2/R3): git-height–derived versioning (MinVer / Nerdbank.GitVersioning / GitVersion) for .NET/JVM/multi-language projects; build identity promoted to a requirement — deployed services MUST expose `version + commit sha + build time` via `/version`|`/health`, and Phase-5 verification MUST assert the sha matches the deployed artifact (#138).

### Deprecated

- **6 workflow skills** marked as `reference` with visible deprecation notices; deprecated runtime commands tagged with a structured `@superseded-by` pointer (XSPEC-291 §4).

### Fixed

- **`uds audit` false positives**: `options/` files reported missing (health check now recurses into subdirectories), CP950 console mojibake, non-TTY crash (#115); unused-standard detection now matches on canonical id rather than filename (#125).
- **Bundle ⇄ source parity restored** — 25 standards synced into the `.standards/` self-adoption tree.
- Numerous docs/i18n integrity fixes: stale standard/skill/command counts, broken locale cross-links, command/skill index regeneration, anchor-slugger and table-parity paths.

## [5.17.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added — Executable SDD consistency & AC-format extensions (XSPEC-262/263/264)

- **`/sdd analyze` — cross-artifact consistency (XSPEC-262, `scripts/sdd-analyze.ts`)**: the executable face of acceptance-criteria-traceability + forward-derivation single-spine. 7 signals — orphan test / uncovered / not_implemented / cross-spec AC conflict / orphan .feature / AC-without-scenario / user-guide↔E2E drift (`T-NNN`, fulfilling XSPEC-260 R5). `npm run sdd:analyze [-- --userguide docs --json]`; 12 bats tests. `/sdd` skill documents the action + ac-coverage division of labour.
- **EARS notation as optional AC format (XSPEC-263)**: `spec-driven-development` v2.2.0→v2.3.0 adds an AC Formats section with 5 EARS templates; `acceptance-criteria.schema.yaml` gains an optional `ears` field (`given/when/then` relaxed from required, backward compatible). GWT remains default & preferred.
- **Structured Bugfix Spec Template (XSPEC-264)**: `sdd-guide.md` splits the bug decision-tree into trivial vs regression-prone, and adds a lightweight `<BUG-ID>.bugfix.md` template (current/expected/**unchanged** behavior + root-cause + regression-test-as-AC).

> Note: `sdd-guide` locale (zh-TW/zh-CN) sync for the Bugfix template is deferred to the XSPEC-248 feature-review loop (pre-existing locale drift).

## [5.16.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added — Test Derivation Chain Extended to the User Guide (XSPEC-260)

- **`core/forward-derivation-standards.md`**: New `## Terminal Projection: User Guide` section + `### Single-Spine Principle`. Extends the derivation pipeline past tests to the user guide — the user guide is the terminal projection of the same AC spine that journey/E2E tests verify by machine. Defines shared `T-NNN` numbering (a user-guide step's `T-NNN` MUST equal a real journey/E2E test id), the user-facing AC filter with conservative default, and the single-spine principle: test/doc sources are N×1 projections of one AC spine, not N×N parallel cross-checks; minting a parallel numbering scheme is a VIOLATION.
- **`ai/standards/forward-derivation-standards.ai.yaml`**: Mirrored `terminal_projection` block + 3 rules (`single-spine-no-parallel-numbering`, `user-guide-shared-tnnn`, `user-facing-ac-conservative-default`).
- **`core/acceptance-criteria-traceability.md`**: New `## User-Documentation Coverage` dimension — tracks whether user-facing AC are documented in the user guide. Includes a user-facing AC filter (conservative default: when in doubt, user-facing), reused ✅/⚠️/❌ status, and a coverage formula excluding non-user-facing and `not_implemented` AC.
- **`ai/standards/acceptance-criteria-traceability.ai.yaml`**: Mirrored `user_doc_coverage` block + 2 rules (`user-doc-user-facing-only`, `user-doc-shared-tnnn`).
- **zh-TW / zh-CN locales**: Both new sections fully translated for both standards.

## [5.15.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added — i18n Layered Language Strategy (XSPEC-239)

- **`core/ai-instruction-standards.md` v1.0.0 → v1.1.0**: New `## Internationalization (i18n)` section defining L1/L2/L3/L4 layered language strategy for SKILL.md and root-level AI instruction files. **Scope extended** from root-level only (`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, ...) to also cover skill-level files (`SKILL.md`). Defines canonical/locale file structure, responsibility boundaries, chimera-prevention rules, and adopter installation model.
- **`ai/standards/ai-instruction-standards.ai.yaml` v1.0.0 → v1.1.0**: Mirrored `i18n:` block + 4 new rules (`i18n-canonical-english-only`, `i18n-locale-must-match-language`, `i18n-l3-template-language-controls-output`, `i18n-no-manual-canonical-edits-by-adopters`).
- **10 missing zh-TW locale skill variants**: `ac-coverage`, `deploy-assistant`, `dev-methodology`, `journey-test-assistant`, `orchestrate`, `plan`, `push`, `skill-builder`, `spec-derivation`, `sweep`. zh-TW skill coverage now 54/54 (100%).
- **`cli/src/lint/i18n.js` + `uds check --i18n` command**: Lint enforcing 5 chimera-prevention rules (`canonical:description-must-be-ascii` error, `locale:description-must-match-language` error, `locale:must-have-source-frontmatter` error, `canonical:l3-language-consistency` warn, `translation-drift-warn` warn). Exit code 1 on errors. `--json` mode for CI.
- **`scripts/generate-locale-coverage.mjs` + auto-generated `locales/COVERAGE.md`**: Coverage matrix per skill/standard per locale + drift warnings. npm script `docs:locale-coverage`.
- **`UDS_LOCALE` environment variable support**: Read in `cli/src/i18n/messages.js detectLanguage()` and `cli/src/commands/update.js resolveLocale()`. Accepts `zh-tw`, `zh_tw`, `zh-cn`, `zh_cn`, `en` (case-insensitive).
- **`.uds/install.yaml` `locale:` field support**: `cli/src/utils/config-manager.js readInstallYaml()` reads optional `locale:` so adopters declare preferred locale once instead of passing `--locale` every time.
- **Locale fallback WARN**: When `installSingleSkill` falls back from a missing locale variant to English, a single end-of-install yellow WARN block lists affected skills. Replaces the previous silent fallback.
- **i18n messages**: New keys `localeFallbackTitle` / `localeFallbackHint` in en/zh-tw/zh-cn locales.

### Changed

- **CLI locale resolution priority** (`cli/src/commands/update.js resolveLocale()`): now 6-tier — `--locale` CLI flag > `.uds/install.yaml` `locale:` > `UDS_LOCALE` env > manifest > `.standards/` detection > `'en'`. Aligned across `init` and `update`.
- **Translations of `core/ai-instruction-standards.md`**: zh-TW and zh-CN locales synced to v1.1.0 with full localized i18n section. (zh-CN section marked pending-review per XSPEC-239 O-2 — translation quality strategy unresolved.)

### Fixed

- **29 canonical SKILL.md description chimera fixed** (XSPEC-239 Phase 1B): removed CJK content from `description:` frontmatter across `adr-assistant`, `ai-collaboration-standards`, `ai-friendly-architecture`, `ai-instruction-standards`, `api-design-assistant`, `audit-assistant`, `ci-cd-assistant`, `contract-test-assistant`, `database-assistant`, `deploy-assistant`, `documentation-guide`, `error-code-guide`, `git-workflow-guide`, `incident-response-assistant`, `journey-test-assistant`, `logging-guide`, `observability-assistant`, `orchestrate`, `plan`, `pr-automation-assistant`, `project-structure-guide`, `push`, `retrospective-assistant`, `runbook-assistant`, `security-assistant`, `security-scan-assistant`, `slo-assistant`, `sweep`, `testing-guide`. Translations live in `locales/{lang}/skills/` instead. Adopters relying on Chinese descriptions in `.claude/skills/` should re-run `uds update --locale zh-TW` (or `--locale zh-CN`).
- **`skills/reverse-engineer/SKILL.md` description em dash (U+2014)** replaced with ASCII hyphen — canonical descriptions must be ASCII-only per new lint rule.
- **`locales/zh-TW/core/self-review-protocol.md` missing YAML frontmatter** added (`source:`, `source_version:`, `translation_version:`, `last_synced:`, `status:`) to match other zh-TW core variants.

### Migration notes for adopters

This release contains potentially user-visible changes for projects that installed UDS with `--locale zh-TW` or `--locale zh-CN` (or had `LANG=zh_*` detected):

- **Re-run `uds update`** after upgrading. Skills whose descriptions previously contained Chinese will now have English `description:` in canonical and full Chinese `description:` + body in the locale variant. Your `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` will be re-installed from the locale variant automatically.
- Adopters who **manually edited canonical** files (added Chinese descriptions in `.claude/skills/`) should reconcile their customizations into locale variants or overlays — see `XSPEC-239` migration section in `core/ai-instruction-standards.md`.
- The new `uds check --i18n` lint can verify your project is clean: errors are blocking, warnings (e.g. `translation-drift-warn`) surface in dashboards but don't fail CI by default.

## [5.14.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **`.github/RELEASE-FLOW-TODOS.md`**: Persistent tracking file for release-flow improvements surfaced during dogfood. Contains TODO-001 ~ TODO-005 (auto docs:generate-index in bump-version.mjs, FB/Threads prompt capture habit, `_template/` validation on next bootstrap, Phase 1.5 social-assets hard gate, Phase 2 Meta API auto-publish workflow). Maintainers edit this file to add new items or resolve existing ones.

### Changed
- **`.github/workflows/release-reminder.yml`**: Now reads `.github/RELEASE-FLOW-TODOS.md` and surfaces open TODOs inside the weekly Monday 09:00 UTC reminder issue body. Improvements compound across release cycles instead of getting lost in commit history.

### Fixed
- **`cli/src/commands/check.js` — false-positive missing standards in AI tool integration check**: `uds check` incorrectly reported `error-code-standards` and `logging-standards` as missing even when the actual `.ai.yaml` files (`error-codes.ai.yaml`, `logging.ai.yaml`) were correctly referenced in `CLAUDE.md`. Root cause: `migrateStandardsPathsToIds()` converts manifest path entries to registry IDs (e.g. `ai/standards/error-codes.ai.yaml` → `error-code-standards`), but the integration file is generated with the actual filename. The check now builds an `id → aiFilename` lookup from the registry and falls back to the actual filename when the ID is not directly found in the integration file content.

## [5.13.3] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed
- **`scripts/pre-release-check.sh` Step 22.5 logic upgrade**: Original implementation (v5.13.0) only accepted Pass A (`[Unreleased]` non-empty). After a CHANGELOG promotion (`[Unreleased]` → `[X.Y.Z]`), the section is correctly emptied but the original check falsely failed and required `--skip-changelog` workaround. New logic adds **Pass B (post-promotion)**: also passes when the latest dated section matches today AND has substantive entries. Also adds **Fail D**: today's dated section exists but is template-only. Surfaced when releasing v5.13.0 — the gate's own pre-release-check fell back to `--skip-changelog` because the gate was already at scenario B.

### Note (translation backfill)
- `locales/zh-TW/CHANGELOG.md` and `locales/zh-CN/CHANGELOG.md` backfilled with the [5.13.1] section that was missed during the v5.13.1 hotfix commit (Edit tool encountered a tool-state issue blocking those two translations).

## [5.13.2] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed
- **`.github/workflows/publish.yml` Clean-room Install Test (XSPEC-221 hotfix v2)**: Replaced `uds init --dry-run` (option not implemented in CLI) with `uds init --help` as the safe non-mutating verification of init command wiring. Surfaced when v5.13.1 publish failed with `error: unknown option '--dry-run'` — the v5.13.1 fix correctly resolved deps but the next verification step relied on a non-existent flag. Second self-bug found by the gate; gate is now exercised end-to-end.

## [5.13.1] - 2026-05-26 [FAILED PUBLISH — see 5.13.2]

### Fixed
- **`.github/workflows/publish.yml` Clean-room Install Test (XSPEC-221 hotfix)**: Added `npm ci --ignore-scripts` step before `npm install -g .` in the alpine clean-room job. Surfaced when v5.13.0 release publish failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package 'commander'` — `npm install -g .` does NOT install transitive dependencies in clean-room environments, requiring deps to exist before the global symlink. The gate (XSPEC-221) correctly blocked a broken release; this fixes the gate's own command sequence.

## [5.13.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- **`core/self-review-protocol.md` v1.0.0** (paired with `ai/standards/self-review-protocol.ai.yaml`, `locales/zh-TW/core/self-review-protocol.md`, and `cli/standards-registry.json` entry): New standard mandating a self-review pass on large markdown edits (>50 lines) before commit. Defines **6 categories of internal cross-reference inconsistency** — diagram/step mismatch, changelog reference errors, count drift, stale templates, wrong tool references, placeholder/rule misalignment — with concrete check methods. Distinguished from code review (covers code), content self-audit (covers completeness), and peer review (covers design). Born from observed `v1.X→v1.X.1` patch cycles in downstream skill editing.
- **`scripts/pre-release-check.sh` Step 22.5 — CHANGELOG hard gate**: Refuses release when `CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased]` section is empty. New `--skip-changelog` flag provides an escape valve (justification expected in release commit message). Inserted between flow gate (step 22) and dogfooding gate (step 23).
- **`scripts/pre-commit.mjs` Step 1.5 — CHANGELOG drift advisory**: Warns (non-blocking, exit 0) when substantive changes are staged (`core/`, `ai/standards/`, `cli/src`, `cli/bin`, `scripts/`, `skills/*/SKILL.md`, `.github/workflows/`) without a paired `CHANGELOG.md` update. Points users to the release-time hard gate so they understand the consequence of ignoring the warning.
- **`.github/workflows/release-reminder.yml`**: Weekly Monday 09:00 UTC cron that opens (or updates) a labeled issue when `CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased]` is non-empty **and** ≥7 days have passed since the latest semver tag. Auto-closes any open reminder when conditions no longer hold. Suggests semver bump heuristic (major/minor/patch) from entry content.
- **`scripts/check-skill-structural-integrity.ts`** (XSPEC-223, P1 release gate): Validates skill `SKILL.md` structural completeness (frontmatter fields, required sections). Wired into `pre-release-check.sh` step 18.5; blocks release if any skill has structural defects.
- **`packaging-standards`** (XSPEC-233 / #112): API migration contract test fixtures section added — defines fixture format for testing API migration compatibility across versions.
- **Clean-room install gate** (XSPEC-221) in `.github/workflows/publish.yml`: Alpine Node 20 container runs `npm install -g .` from `cli/`, verifies `uds --version` / `uds list` / `uds init --dry-run`. Blocks the `publish` job if any step fails.
- **Dogfooding gate** (XSPEC-222) — `scripts/pre-release-check.sh` step 23: New CLI build must pass `uds check` against itself before release proceeds.

### Changed
- **`core/deployment-standards.md`** (XSPEC-231 / #110 + #113): Defensive deploy pairing — mandates archive integrity verification + extract-verify-then-delete pattern. Closes the "corrupted archive deleted before verification" failure class.
- **`core/logging-standards.md`** (XSPEC-232 / #111): Mandatory dual-trigger log rotation policy — both size **AND** time triggers must be configured (not OR). Closes the "rotation never fired because size threshold never hit" failure mode.
- **`skills/contract-test-assistant/SKILL.md`** and **`skills/runbook-assistant/SKILL.md`**: Minor updates supporting XSPEC-231/232/233 patterns.
- **Dependencies (`cli/`)**: `lint-staged` 17.0.3→17.0.4 (#107), `@inquirer/prompts` 8.4.2→8.4.3 (#106), `eslint` 10.3.0→10.4.0 (#105), `@vitest/coverage-v8` 4.1.5→4.1.6 (#103), `vitest` 4.1.5→4.1.6 (#101), `@commitlint/cli` 21.0.0→21.0.1 (#104), `tsx` 4.21.0→4.22.3 (#109).
- **CI actions**: `actions/checkout` 4→6 (#98), `actions/setup-node` 4→6 (#99).

## [5.12.1] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- **`full-coverage-testing.ai.yaml`** (`no-tautology-assertions` rule, XSPEC-220): AI agents generating unimplemented test skeletons MUST use `it.todo("AC-XXX: ...")` instead of `it() { expect(true).toBe(true) }`. Any `it()` callback containing only tautology assertions is an `[ANTI-FAKE-001]` violation regardless of whether generated by a human or an AI agent.
- **`test-governance.ai.yaml`** (`gate-wiring-required` rule, XSPEC-220): Quality detection scripts (anti-fake, stub-check, coverage ratchet) MUST appear in at least one CI workflow job AND at least one local hook. A script that exists in `scripts/` but is never called by CI is equivalent to not existing and constitutes a governance gap.
- **`acceptance-criteria-traceability.ai.yaml`** (`not_implemented` status, XSPEC-220): Extended definition to explicitly map `it.todo()` placeholders to `not_implemented 🚫` status (excluded from coverage denominator), with decision tree distinguishing `not_implemented` (deliberate placeholder) from `uncovered` (oversight).

## [5.12.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **`docs/user/` user documentation hub** (XSPEC-211): New dual-track documentation structure mirroring VibeOps conventions. Contains 8 files serving first-time users and daily users:
  - `docs/user/GETTING-STARTED.md` — 5-minute end-to-end walkthrough (install → `uds init` → `/sdd` → `/commit`)
  - `docs/user/SKILLS-INDEX.md` — auto-generated index of all 54 skills, organized by Tier (DEC-061) and Category, plus "When to Use" quick reference
  - `docs/user/COMMANDS-INDEX.md` — auto-generated alphabetical listing of all 48 slash commands with skill mapping
  - `docs/user/FAQ.md` — 14 questions covering installation, skills, SDD, updating, and architecture
  - `docs/user/GLOSSARY.md` — definitions for UDS, SDD, ATDD, BDD, TDD, XSPEC, Dual-Layer, Skill Tier, Standard, Activity, Bundle/Source, ADR, AC
  - `docs/user/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` — problem→solution guide (installation, skills not showing, non-Claude-Code tools, update failures), absorbing `SKILL-FALLBACK-GUIDE.md`
  - `docs/user/README.md` — three-audience doc hub (new users / daily users / maintainers) with document map
  - `docs/user/CHEATSHEET.md` — moved from `docs/` (no content change)
- **`scripts/generate-skill-index.ts`** — generates `SKILLS-INDEX.md` and `COMMANDS-INDEX.md` from `uds-manifest.json` + `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter. Uses SKILL.md `name` field as authoritative command source. Run: `npm run docs:generate-index`
- **`scripts/check-skill-index.ts`** — pre-commit guard; regenerates docs and diffs; exits non-zero if stale. Run: `npm run docs:check-index`
- **`scripts/setup-hooks.sh`** — installs `.git/hooks/pre-commit` to call `docs:check-index` on every commit
- **`.github/workflows/docs-check.yml`** — CI job that verifies `SKILLS-INDEX.md` and `COMMANDS-INDEX.md` are in sync when `uds-manifest.json`, `skills/*/SKILL.md`, or `cli/standards-registry.json` are modified in a PR
- **`docs/reference/FEATURE-REFERENCE.md`** — `FEATURE-REFERENCE.md` relocated from `docs/` to `docs/reference/` (auto-generated, no content change)
- **`docs/archive/USER-MANUAL-2026-03-24.md`** — archived copy of the deprecated User Manual

### Changed
- **`package.json`**: Added `docs:generate-index` (`tsx scripts/generate-skill-index.ts`) and `docs:check-index` (`tsx scripts/check-skill-index.ts`) scripts
- **`scripts/generate-usage-docs.mjs`**: Updated English output paths — `FEATURE-REFERENCE.md` now writes to `docs/reference/`, `CHEATSHEET.md` now writes to `docs/user/`
- **`skills/README.md`**: Added banner pointing to `docs/user/SKILLS-INDEX.md` and `COMMANDS-INDEX.md` as the primary indexed skill reference
- **`README.md`**: Added "📚 Documentation" table in Quick Start section, listing all 7 `docs/user/` files with direct links
- **`docs/USER-MANUAL.md`**: Added deprecation banner directing users to `docs/user/README.md`; archived copy preserved at `docs/archive/USER-MANUAL-2026-03-24.md`

### Removed
- **`docs/SKILL-FALLBACK-GUIDE.md`**: Content merged into `docs/user/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`. Non-Claude-Code fallback strategies and Skill→Core Standard mapping table are preserved under the "Using UDS Without Claude Code" section

## [5.11.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **`spec-driven-development`** SPEC Type Agent variant: `acceptance-criteria-traceability.ai.yaml` and the SDD template gain a `spec-type: feature | agent | infrastructure` field, plus a five-section Agent SPEC template (capability surface / decision boundaries / observability / failure modes / cross-agent invariants). Enables Builder/QA/Planner-style SPECs to be tracked separately from feature SPECs and linked back to specific agents via the new `agent-id` field. (XSPEC-205)
- **`reverse-engineering-standards`** migration inventory bidirectionality: new routing-driven discovery method (filesystem-glob starting points are now forbidden), target→source bidirectional scan, and `[GAP]` marker protocol for findings that have no corresponding source artefact. Pairs with a new `migration_testing` section in `testing.ai.yaml` requiring a 3-step schema parity pattern enforced via CI gate. Closes UDS Issues #96 and #97. (XSPEC-206)

### Fixed
- **`uds update` spurious "CLAUDE.md.md: 無法判斷來源" restore failure for schema 3.x manifests** (`cli/src/utils/integration-generator.js`, `cli/src/commands/update.js`): Schema 3.x manifests store **filenames** (e.g. `"CLAUDE.md"`) in `manifest.integrations`, not tool keys. The `getToolFileName` fallback at `integration-generator.js:56` unconditionally appended `".md"`, so `getToolFilePath("CLAUDE.md")` returned `"CLAUDE.md.md"`, was reported as a missing file, and failed to restore (`getSourcePathFromRelative` had no mapping for the synthetic path). Commit `79532b3` (5.10.0) fixed the inverse case (tool-name input) but missed this filename variant. Fix: precompute `KNOWN_TOOL_FILES` from `SUPPORTED_AI_TOOLS` and short-circuit when input is a known integration filename or already carries a known file extension (`.md`/`.yaml`/`.yml`/`.json`). 5 new regression tests in `integration-generator.test.js`. (XSPEC-208 BUG-208-01)
- **`uds update` / `uds check` spurious "Integration UDS Block Integrity: GEMINI.md/AGENTS.md missing" warnings** (`cli/src/commands/update.js`, `cli/src/i18n/messages.js`): `manifest.integrationBlockHashes` accumulated entries on every install but was never pruned. When `manifest.aiTools` shrank (e.g. `["claude-code","gemini-cli"]` → `["claude-code"]`) the GEMINI.md hash remained and `check.js:1491 checkIntegrationBlocksIntegrity` falsely reported the file as missing. Fix: after the integration regeneration step, derive the expected file set from `manifest.aiTools` (the declared configuration, NOT `results.integrations` which over-prunes on transient write failures) and prune any orphaned hash. Pruned filenames are reported via a new i18n key `prunedOrphanedBlockHashes` (en / zh-TW / zh-CN). 3 new regression tests in `update.test.js`. Reproduced on machine-setup `uds update` 5.1.0-beta.4 → 5.10.0; verified fixed on 5.10.0 → 5.11.0. (XSPEC-208 BUG-208-02)

## [5.10.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **`multi-environment-e2e-testing`** (`ai/standards/multi-environment-e2e-testing.ai.yaml`): New standard for E2E test configuration across multiple deployment targets. Core principle: "The run command IS the documentation." Covers: BASE_URL baked into test framework config (not .env); self-checking runner scripts per environment; environment capability matrix committed to repo; CI gate mapping; credential handling rules. Closes UDS Issue #95. (XSPEC-204)

### Changed
- **`mock-boundary`** (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0): Added Level 1 / Level 2 mock layer distinction. Level 1 = code-level mocks regulated by STUB rules. Level 2 = infrastructure-level stub servers (WireMock, MockSoap) regulated by environment stratification rules, NOT subject to STUB deployment-blocking. Added `external_dependency_testability_matrix` template (✅/⚠️/❌ per service × environment). Added rules: `level-2-stub-server-rules`, `no-stub-server-in-prd`. Closes UDS Issue #94 Blind Spot 2. (XSPEC-204)
- **`deployment-standards`** (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0): Added `environment_stratification_matrix` block — projects with external dependencies must build this matrix at test-planning time; template includes 10-flow × 3-environment grid. Added `stub_server_cicd_rules` block — Option A (sidecar deploy) / Option B (PRD smoke deferral); production artifact exclusion rules; PRD prohibition rules; forbidden state definition. Closes UDS Issue #94 Blind Spots 1 & 3. (XSPEC-204)
- **`verification-evidence`** (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0): Added Iron Law (Environment): evidence must specify `environment_layer` for externally-dependent ACs. Added `environment_layer` field to evidence format (required for features with external service dependencies). Added rules VE-005, VE-006. (XSPEC-204)
- **`test-completeness-dimensions`** (v1.2.0 → v1.3.0): Added Dimension 11: **Environment Verifiability** — for ACs with external service dependencies, document minimum verifiable environment layer (local/UAT/PRD), track PRD-only items, require smoke test plan. Updated feature type mapping: External Integration → [1,3,7,11]; new type External-Dependent Workflow → [1,3,4,5,9,10,11]. Updated use-checklist rule. (XSPEC-204)

### Fixed
- **`uds update` spurious "missing file" restore for integration tool names**: When `manifest.integrations` contained AI tool identifiers (`"claude-code"`, `"opencode"`), the update command pushed them directly into `allTrackedFiles` as file paths instead of resolving them via `getToolFilePath()`. This caused `existsSync("claude-code")` to return false, triggering a spurious "⚠ N file(s) still missing after update" warning and "✗ claude-code: 無法判斷來源" restore failures. Fix: resolve each entry via `getToolFilePath(int)` first; skip entries that don't map to a real path. Reproduced on `uds update` 5.7.2 → 5.8.0.

## [5.9.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **`feature-discovery-standards`** (`ai/standards/feature-discovery-standards.ai.yaml`, `core/feature-discovery-standards.md`): New standard defining language-agnostic methodology for exhaustive feature discovery in legacy systems. Establishes the **Deterministic-First principle** (AI prohibited from generating feature lists through inference alone in Discovery Phase). Defines Software Form Taxonomy for 7 forms (web/cli/gui/daemon/library/mobile/embedded) with detection signals and extraction tools. Defines Five Static Foundations (entry points → call graph → string mining → resource files → external interfaces), Dynamic Observation Protocol (Linux/macOS/Windows), Human Observation Protocol (confidence: 0.7 rule), and Cross-Layer Validation Matrix template. Pipeline position: Discovery → feature-manifest → behavior-snapshot. (XSPEC-202)
- **`ai/language-packs/language-pack-php-to-csharp.ai.yaml`**: First UDS Language Pack for PHP→C# (ASP.NET Core) migration risks. Contains 7 risk labels (SESSION_HANDLING, ORM_DIFFERENCES, TIMEZONE_HANDLING, FILE_UPLOAD_PATH, REGEX_DIFFERENCES, ARRAY_FUNCTIONS, EXCEPTION_HIERARCHY) with detailed descriptions. (XSPEC-203)
- **`ai/language-packs/README.md`**: Language pack naming convention, usage guide, and contributing instructions. (XSPEC-203)

### Changed
- **`feature-manifest-standard`** (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0): Refactored `migration_risks` to language-agnostic architecture. Removed `php_to_csharp` hardcoded block (migrated to `ai/language-packs/`). Added `language_packs` Extension Point (`extension_point: true`). Added 3 new generic risk labels: CONCURRENCY_MODEL, PACKAGE_ECOSYSTEM, TYPE_SYSTEM. (XSPEC-203)
- **`behavior-snapshot`** (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0): Extended from HTTP-only to multi-modal. Added `adapter` field (default: `http`, backward compatible). Added `adapters` section with 4 concrete schemas: `http` / `cli` / `file` / `event`. Added `adapter-selection` and `backward-compatibility` rules. Existing HTTP snapshots without `adapter` field remain valid. (XSPEC-203)

## [5.8.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **`feature-manifest-standard`** (`ai/standards/feature-manifest-standard.ai.yaml`, `core/feature-manifest-standard.md`): New standard defining the FM-NNN machine-readable feature inventory format for migration/refactoring projects. Includes confidence scoring, migration risk labels (PHP→C#), FEATURE_STUB: marker protocol, and Gate 1 completeness gate. (XSPEC-200)
- **`behavior-snapshot`** (`ai/standards/behavior-snapshot.ai.yaml`, `core/behavior-snapshot.md`): New standard defining HTTP golden-file snapshot format for migration parity verification and refactoring characterization tests. Includes snapshot schema, `ignore_fields` guidance, parity gate (exit codes 0/1/2), and Gate 0 characterization test protocol. (XSPEC-201)

### Changed
- **`acceptance-criteria-traceability`**: Added 4th AC status `not_implemented` (🚫) — distinct from `uncovered` (code exists but no test) and `not_implemented` (code does not exist). Updated coverage formula to exclude `not_implemented` from denominator. Added CI gate rule: `not_implemented_count > 0` → blocking (independent of coverage % gate). Added decision tree for status classification. (XSPEC-199)

## [5.7.3] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- **`uds update` stale-ID skip** (`cli/src/commands/update.js`): Four loops (display, copy, hash recomputation, post-update integrity check) now skip unrecognized short IDs in `manifest.standards` (entries that contain neither `/` nor `.` but have no matching registry entry, e.g. stale AI tool names `claude-code`, `opencode`). Previously these caused spurious "missing file" warnings and failed restore attempts during `uds update`.

## [5.7.2] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- **Manifest schema v3.4.0 — `standards` path→ID migration** (`cli/src/core/manifest.js`): Added `migrateToV340()` migration step and `migrateStandardsPathsToIds()` helper. Manifests whose `standards` array contains legacy path-format entries (e.g. `"ai/standards/foo.ai.yaml"`) are now automatically converted to short registry IDs (e.g. `"foo"`) when loaded. Option file paths (`ai/options/…`) are preserved as-is. An `ensureRequiredFields()` safety net runs even when the schema version already matches, guarding against partially-written manifests. (`cli/src/core/manifest.js`, `cli/src/reconciler/desired-state-calculator.js`)
- **`uds check` legacy existence check** (`cli/src/commands/check.js`): The no-hash fallback path now resolves registry-ID-format standards to their actual source filenames (e.g. `"testing"` → `"testing.ai.yaml"`), and correctly routes option file paths into `.standards/options/`. Previously, ID-format standards resulted in path-less lookups that always reported "missing".
- **`uds update` ID-format support** (`cli/src/commands/update.js`): Five code paths (`checkNewStandards`, file list display, file copy loop, hash recomputation, post-update integrity scan) now resolve ID-format standards to source paths via the registry, so projects whose manifests have been migrated to v3.4.0 continue to receive correct file operations.
- **`uds audit` health/friction checks** (`cli/src/utils/health-checker.js`, `cli/src/utils/friction-detector.js`): Both utilities now resolve ID-format standards to actual filenames before checking disk/CLAUDE.md references, preventing false-OK results on migrated manifests.

## [5.7.1] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- **`cli/package-lock.json`**: Sync lock file to fix `npm ci` failure on GitHub Actions (`@emnapi/core` and `@emnapi/runtime` entries were missing).

### Removed
- **`specs/`**: Removed 4 spec files already migrated to dev-platform as XSPECs (SPEC-frontend-design-standard, SPEC-mcp-design-standards-server, superspec-borrowing-phase1-2-spec, superspec-phase4-spec). Retained `execution-history-spec.md` (Archived), `schemas/`, and `standards-effectiveness-schema.json`.
- **`docs/archive/`**: Removed 7 outdated migration guides and workflow analysis documents.
- **`.project-context/`**: Removed gemini-cli auto-generated artifact (content covered by `CLAUDE.md`).

### Added
- **`.npmignore`**: Exclude `tests/`, `scripts/`, `.github/`, `.githooks/`, `.gemini/`, `.release-readiness/`, `docs/internal/` from the npm package. These were previously published unintentionally (no `files` field or `.npmignore` existed).

**Adopter note**: If you previously relied on any files from `tests/` or `scripts/` installed from npm, install them from the GitHub repo directly.

## [5.7.0] - 2026-05-08

> **Cross-platform script migration** (XSPEC-179 + XSPEC-180): Bash scripts are
> being progressively replaced by single-source TypeScript / Node.js ESM
> equivalents that run unchanged on macOS / Linux / Windows. Legacy `.sh` files
> remain with `DEPRECATED` notices for backward compatibility.

### Removed

- **Ecosystem section in README** (`README.md`, `locales/zh-TW/README.md`,
  `locales/zh-CN/README.md`): Removed `## 🌐 Ecosystem` / `## 🌐 生態系統` /
  `## 🌐 生态系统` section entirely. UDS is a standalone tool-agnostic standards
  library; the section's heading suggested an "ecosystem of products" that no
  longer applies after downstream-project decoupling (Batch 1–6, 2026-05-04).
  Tool compatibility list (Claude Code / Cursor / etc.) is preserved earlier in
  the README.

### Added

- **Skill tiering & budget tuning** (XSPEC-185 / DEC-061): Three-tier classification (Core / Advanced / Specialist) for the 40+ UDS skills, addressing Claude Code's `/doctor` warning about truncated skill descriptions when adopters install extra plugins. New artifacts:
  - `skills/README.md` §Skill Tiers — tier membership table
  - `flows/skill-tiering-rationale.md` — tiering criteria and DEC-051 mapping
  - `examples/skill-overrides-recommended.json` — copy-paste `skillOverrides` reference (Tier 3 → `"name-only"`)
  - `docs/skill-budget-tuning.md` — adopter guide (user/project settings, customization, raising budget)

  **Adopter action (optional)**: merge the `skillOverrides` block from `examples/skill-overrides-recommended.json` into your `~/.claude/settings.json` or project `.claude/settings.json`. Tier 3 skills remain callable via `/<name>` — only Claude's auto-discovery listing is suppressed. See `docs/skill-budget-tuning.md`.
- **AI tool table coverage** (`README.md`, `locales/zh-TW/README.md`, `locales/zh-CN/README.md`): Added five previously missing tools — GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex, Aider, Continue, Google Antigravity. Introduced a ⚠ Minimal status legend entry. (`1b588e1`)
- **`scripts/bump-version.mjs`** (XSPEC-179 Phase 1): Cross-platform version-bump implementation, on par with the legacy `.sh`. (`1a44e14`)
- **`scripts/install-hooks.mjs`** (XSPEC-179 Phase 1): Cross-platform git hooks installer; skips `chmod` automatically on Windows. (`1a44e14`)
- **`scripts/pre-commit.mjs`** (XSPEC-180): Node.js ESM implementation of the pre-commit hook, with a platform branch that calls `check-translation-sync.ps1` on Windows and `.sh` elsewhere. (`1572869`)
- **7 TypeScript check scripts** (XSPEC-179 Phase 2, `0a26d14`): Migrated from bash to a single TypeScript source executed via `tsx`:
  - `scripts/check-ai-behavior-sync.ts`
  - `scripts/check-commit-spec-reference.ts`
  - `scripts/check-flow-gate-report.ts`
  - `scripts/check-integration-commands-sync.ts`
  - `scripts/check-registry-completeness.ts`
  - `scripts/check-release-readiness-signoff.ts`
  - `scripts/check-workflow-compliance.ts`
- **`tsx@^4.20.0`** added to root `devDependencies` (XSPEC-179 Phase 2, `0a26d14`).
- **7 npm scripts** wiring the TypeScript checks (`0a26d14`): `check:ai-behavior`, `check:commit-spec`, `check:flow-gate`, `check:integration-commands`, `check:registry`, `check:release-signoff`, `check:workflow-compliance`.

### Changed

- **Downstream-project decoupling** (6 Batches, `ebe716c`–`2392c0f`): All public-facing references to specific downstream projects (DevAP / VibeOps) replaced with adoption-layer neutral terminology across 130+ files. UDS is reaffirmed as a pure MIT + CC BY 4.0 standards library independent of any specific adoption layer. Key areas: `README.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/locales, `.standards/`/`ai/standards/` DEPRECATED stubs, `core/*.md`/locale mirrors, `cli/` source + tests, `skills/*/SKILL.md`, `flows/*.flow.yaml`/`flows/README.md`, `docs/specs/`, `specs/` root, `packaging-standards`, `git-worktree` path examples.

- **REGISTRY**: `roo-code` integration tier moved from `planned` to `partial`; Roo Code split out from the Cline row in the AI tool table. (`1b588e1`)
- **`.githooks/pre-commit`** (XSPEC-180, `1572869`): Reduced from a 51-line bash implementation to a 16-line POSIX `sh` shim that delegates to `scripts/pre-commit.mjs`.
- **`scripts/bump-version.mjs`** (`19ad314`): Added `buildCmd()` helper that switches to PowerShell + `.ps1` on Windows when invoking `check-version-sync` / `check-translation-sync`, restoring parity on Windows.
- **XSPEC-179 Phase 2 strategy revision** (`0a26d14`): Abandoned the previous `.sh` + `.ps1` dual-track plan in favour of a **single TypeScript source** approach. A single `.ts` file runs unchanged across all platforms via `tsx`, eliminating the "can only verify on Windows" feedback gap.

### Deprecated

- **`scripts/bump-version.sh`** (`1a44e14`): Marked DEPRECATED; superseded by `bump-version.mjs`.
- **`scripts/install-hooks.sh`** (`1a44e14`): Marked DEPRECATED; superseded by `install-hooks.mjs`.
- **7 legacy `check-*.sh` scripts** (`0a26d14`): Their `.ts` counterparts (above) are now the canonical implementation. The `.sh` files are retained for legacy Linux/macOS environments but should not receive new features.

### Removed

- **`.devap/` directory** (`2392c0f`): Orphan DevAP dogfooding installation removed. DevAP retired 2026-04-28 (XSPEC-086/095); UDS now uses `flows/commit.flow.yaml` natively and `scripts/bump-version.mjs` for releases.

### Fixed

- **`scripts/check-release-readiness-signoff.sh`** (`0a26d14`, latent bug fixed in TypeScript port): Faulty `grep -c "0\n0"` pattern (which never matched a literal `\n`) corrected so missing sign-off signals are detected reliably.
- **`scripts/check-integration-commands-sync.sh`** (`0a26d14`, latent bug fixed in TypeScript port): Eliminated SIGPIPE noise originating from a broken pipe between `find` and downstream consumers.

## [5.6.0] - 2026-05-06

> **Minor Release**: Full Coverage Testing Paradigm (XSPEC-178) — abolishes pyramid thresholds in favour of behaviour-completeness (happy / edge / error path per public function), ratchet CI, anti-fake-test enforcement, and STUB marker protocol.

### Added

- **`ai/standards/full-coverage-testing.ai.yaml`** — New standard defining the Full Coverage Testing Paradigm: behaviour-completeness model, ratchet CI policy, anti-fake-test rules (no tautology assertions, no mocking core business logic), STUB marker protocol, `@ac` AC-traceability tagging, and `COVERAGE_EXEMPT` exemption format (XSPEC-178)
- **`core/full-coverage-testing.md`** — Human-readable companion to the new YAML standard; required by pre-commit standards-sync hook

### Changed

- **`ai/standards/testing.ai.yaml`**: Added `deprecated_rules` block; pyramid threshold rules (`follow-pyramid`) deprecated since v5.5.0 and replaced by `follow-full-coverage` pointing to the new standard
- **`ai/options/testing/unit-testing.ai.yaml`**: Removed `pyramid_percentage: 70%`; replaced with `coverage_policy: "Behaviour-completeness ratchet (XSPEC-178)"`
- **`ai/options/testing/integration-testing.ai.yaml`**: Removed `pyramid_percentage: 20%`; replaced with ratchet coverage policy targeting all critical integration paths
- **`cli/standards-registry.json`**: Added `full-coverage-testing` entry (category: `skill`, skillName: `testing-guide`); updated `testing` entry description to remove pyramid threshold percentages
- **`cli/src/commands/init.js`**: `standardOptions` now includes `coverage_model: 'full-coverage'` default
- **`cli/src/commands/update.js`**: v5.5.0 migration block sets `options.coverage_model = 'full-coverage'` on upgrade and prints paradigm-shift notice
- **`cli/src/commands/check.js`**: Added `checkFullCoverageCompliance()` — warns when `full-coverage-testing.ai.yaml` is missing in v5.5.0+ projects, reports STUB marker count in `src/`

### Also in this release (post-v5.5.0 fixes)

- **`core/`**: Added `release-readiness-gate.md` aggregation standard; extended `browser-compatibility-standards.md`; closed coverage gaps for a11y threshold, contract testing, cross-flow regression, and capacity sign-off
- **`templates/`**: Expanded flow test matrix to multi-gate model with UAT script column; added flow specification section to `requirement-template.md`
- **`flows/`**: Wired Multi-Gate Flow into RQM and pre-release pipeline
- **`cli/package.json`**: Bumped `@inquirer/prompts` 8.4.2, `ora` 9.4.0, `vitest` 4.1.5, `ajv` 8.20.0, `opencc-js` 1.3.0, `@commitlint` 20.5.3
- **CLAUDE.md / docs**: Added XSPEC-176 source-of-truth precedence note

### Migration from Pyramid Thresholds

Projects upgrading from `< 5.5.0` will receive a migration notice via `uds update`:

```
⚠ Testing paradigm migrated to Full Coverage (XSPEC-178).
  full-coverage-testing.ai.yaml installed. Remove coverageThreshold from jest/vitest config.
```

See `core/full-coverage-testing.md` for the complete migration checklist (delete `coverageThreshold`, install `.coverage-baseline.json`, add ratchet scripts to CI).

## [5.5.0] - 2026-05-05

> **Minor Release**: 17 New Standards — Testing Security, LLM Output Validation, Supply Chain Integrity, Release Quality. See [GitHub Release](https://github.com/AsiaOstrich/universal-dev-standards/releases/tag/v5.5.0) for full notes.

## [5.4.0] - 2026-04-27

> **Minor Release**: XSPEC-086 Phase 2 — 8 個純流程/編排標準遷移至 DevAP（deprecated stubs 保留向後相容）。UDS 職責回歸活動定義層，流程編排交由 DevAP 負責（DEC-049）。

### Deprecated（XSPEC-086 Phase 2 — 遷移至 DevAP）

下列 8 個標準已遷移至 `dev-autopilot/standards/`，成為 DevAP canonical 位置。UDS 保留 deprecated stub 至 v6.0.0。

**`ai/standards/flow/`（已遷入 DevAP `standards/flow/`）**
- `workflow-enforcement.ai.yaml` → `dev-autopilot/standards/flow/workflow-enforcement.ai.yaml`
- `workflow-state-protocol.ai.yaml` → `dev-autopilot/standards/flow/workflow-state-protocol.ai.yaml`
- `change-batching-standards.ai.yaml` → `dev-autopilot/standards/flow/change-batching-standards.ai.yaml`
- `branch-completion.ai.yaml` → `dev-autopilot/standards/flow/branch-completion.ai.yaml`
- `pipeline-integration-standards.ai.yaml` → `dev-autopilot/standards/flow/pipeline-integration-standards.ai.yaml`

**`ai/standards/orchestration/`（已遷入 DevAP `standards/orchestration/`）**
- `agent-dispatch.ai.yaml` → `dev-autopilot/standards/orchestration/agent-dispatch.ai.yaml`
- `agent-communication-protocol.ai.yaml` → `dev-autopilot/standards/orchestration/agent-communication-protocol.ai.yaml`
- `execution-history.ai.yaml` → `dev-autopilot/standards/orchestration/execution-history.ai.yaml`

### Changed

- `cli/standards-registry.json`：8 個標準條目標記 `deprecated: true`、`deprecatedSince: "5.4.0"`、`removalVersion: "6.0.0"`、`canonicalOwner: "devap"`、`canonicalPath`
- `cli/tests/unit/core/execution-history-standards.test.js`：測試更新為驗證 deprecated stub 結構（meta.deprecated + canonical_path），22 tests 通過

### Migration Guide

安裝 DevAP 並載入對應標準以取得完整的流程執行能力：

```bash
npm install -g dev-autopilot
# 各標準 canonical 位置見 dev-autopilot/standards/README.md
```

UDS 5.x 仍提供 deprecated stubs（含 fallback 規則），UDS 6.0.0 將完全移除。

## [5.3.2] - 2026-04-27

> **Patch Release**: Bug fix — `uds update -y` now auto-installs/updates Skills and Commands instead of only showing hints.

### Fixed
- **`uds update --yes` / `-y`** (`cli/src/commands/update.js`): The `--yes` flag previously skipped Skills and Commands installation entirely, printing a "New features available" hint instead. It now mirrors the interactive path — missing Skills/Commands are installed immediately and outdated ones are updated. The manifest and integration files are refreshed accordingly. Fixes the regression where `uds update -y` left `.claude/` Skills unchanged while interactive `uds update` updated them.

## [5.3.1] - 2026-04-27

> **Patch Release**: Bug fix — `uds check` no longer falsely warns "AGENTS.md standards out of sync" after `uds update`.

### Fixed
- **`generateAgentsMdSummary()`** (`integration-generator.js`): Removed `.slice(0, 30)` cap that caused AGENTS.md to list only 30 of all installed standards. `uds check` compares against all manifest standards, so the truncation always produced a false "out of sync" warning. Generator now lists all installed `.ai.yaml` standards; check passes cleanly.

## [5.3.0] - 2026-04-26

> **Minor Release**: Four new standards + one new Skill (XSPEC-085/064) — `no-cicd-deployment`, `rollback-standards`, `cd-deployment-strategies`, `pipeline-security-gates`, and `/deploy` Skill. Total standards: 136.

### Added
- **`no-cicd-deployment.ai.yaml`** (XSPEC-085 Phase 1): Three-layer deployment architecture for no-CI/CD environments — `set -euo pipefail` + deploy.lock + version tag enforcement; smoke test + auto-rollback; Blue-Green <30s rollback.
- **`rollback-standards.ai.yaml`** (XSPEC-064 Phase 1): Rollback trigger matrix — auto (error rate >2× baseline), assisted (SLO violated), manual (latency within SLO). Error budget <10% escalates to auto. P0–P3 severity with SLA.
- **`cd-deployment-strategies.ai.yaml`** (XSPEC-064 Phase 1): Strategy selection matrix — blue-green / canary / rolling / recreate decision tree (traffic × risk × cost). No-CI/CD compatibility notes included.
- **`pipeline-security-gates.ai.yaml`** (XSPEC-064 Phase 1): CI security gate positions — pre-commit secrets scan, post-build SAST, post-staging DAST, package-stage SCA+SBOM. Critical/High block pipeline; Medium requires approval.
- **`/deploy` Skill** (`skills/deploy-assistant/`, XSPEC-085 Phase 1b): Interactive no-CI/CD deployment script generator with zh-TW locale translation.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-04-24

> **Minor Release**: Three new standards/skills (XSPEC-080/081/082) — `/release package` sub-command, `/push` Quality Gate Skill, and `agent-behavior-discipline` standard (Karpathy four principles: Ask/Simple/Precision/Test). Bundle parity hardened. Docs centralized to dev-platform. Total standards: 74.

### Added
- **`agent-behavior-discipline.ai.yaml`** (Trial, expires 2026-10-24, XSPEC-082 / DEC-048): New governance standard encoding Andrej Karpathy's four AI Agent behavioral principles — Ask (surface assumptions before executing), Simple (minimum sufficient code), Precision (surgical changes only), Test (define verifiable success criteria + self-correction loop). Integrated into `uds-manifest.json` (74th entry) and `cli/standards-registry.json`.
- **`/push` Skill** (`skills/push/`, XSPEC-081): Git push quality gates and collaboration guardrails — protected branch detection, force-push guard, pre-push gate validation, push receipt audit log, PR integration entry point. Includes two configuration options: `options/push/single-owner-mode.ai.yaml` (reduced guardrails for solo repos) and `options/push/team-mode.ai.yaml` (full guardrails, confirmation required for teams).
- **`/release package` sub-command** (`skills/release/`, XSPEC-080): Packaging guidance for 10 target formats — npm/Node.js, Python/PyPI, Go binary, Electron app, Homebrew formula (Wave 1) + Rust/Cargo, Tauri desktop, Docker image, VS Code Extension, GitHub Release asset (Wave 2). Detection-first design: auto-detects project type before applying packaging steps.

### Fixed
- **Bundle parity** (XSPEC-072 Phase 2): Resolved parity gap between `ai/standards/` and `bundle/` — all 74 standards now present in the bundle. CI hardened to hard-fail (exit 1) on any parity mismatch, preventing silent bundle drift.
- **i18n NO META frontmatters** (BUG-A06): Added missing YAML frontmatter to 36 translation files that were flagged as `NO META` — fixes translation sync validation false positives.

### Changed
- **Docs centralization (DEC-047 Batch 2)**: Migrated UDS planning/governance docs to the AsiaOstrich dev-platform planning hub. These files are no longer distributed with UDS:
  - `docs/AI-AGENT-ROADMAP.md` → dev-platform `cross-project/roadmap/uds-agent-roadmap.md`
  - `docs/OPERATION-WORKFLOW.md` → dev-platform `cross-project/ops/uds-operation.md`
  - `docs/internal/AGENT-PROTOCOL.md` → dev-platform `cross-project/ops/uds-agent-protocol.md`
  - `docs/internal/AI-AGENT-SYNC-SOP.md` → dev-platform `cross-project/ops/uds-ai-agent-sync-sop.md`
  - `docs/internal/INTEGRATION-SIMPLIFICATION-PROPOSAL.md` → dev-platform `cross-project/ops/uds-integration-simplification-proposal.md`
  - Locale copies (`locales/zh-TW/docs/`, `locales/zh-CN/docs/`) of ROADMAP and OPERATION-WORKFLOW also removed.

[5.2.0]: https://github.com/AsiaOstrich/universal-dev-standards/compare/v5.1.1...v5.2.0

## [5.1.1] - 2026-04-20

> **Patch Release**: Windows CI fix, skill `name` field added to 53 SKILL.md files, three `.md` source standards updated with incident rules from BUG-A08 post-mortem, zh-TW/zh-CN translations synced.

### Fixed
- **`cli/src/utils/directory-mapper.js`**: Replace `dir.split('/').pop()` with `path.basename(dir)` for Windows cross-platform compatibility — fixes `directory-mapper.test.js` failures on Windows CI runners.

### Added
- **`name` field** added to 9 source `skills/*/SKILL.md` files and 44 `locales/zh-TW/skills/*/SKILL.md` files — required by skill validation tooling.

### Changed
- **`core/test-governance.md`** 1.0.0 → 1.1.0: added `test-execution-continuity` rule (BUG-A08 post-mortem — 22 tests existed but were never wired to CI execution triggers).
- **`core/checkin-standards.md`** 1.5.0 → 1.6.0: added Legacy Project File Sync (`project-file-sync`) section — every source file on disk must be registered in legacy project manifest files.
- **`core/testing-standards.md`** 3.1.0 → 3.2.0: added E2E Precondition Scope (`e2e-precondition-scope`) section — E2E pre-checks must verify all pages/endpoints under test, not just the auth entry point.
- **zh-TW and zh-CN translations** synced for `test-governance.md`, `checkin-standards.md`, and `testing-standards.md`.

[5.1.1]: https://github.com/AsiaOstrich/universal-dev-standards/compare/v5.1.0...v5.1.1

## [5.1.0] - 2026-04-20

> **Stable Release**: BUG-A06 i18n completeness — 32 missing translations added, semver-aware translation gate, new `translation-lifecycle-standards` UDS standard. BUG-A07 shell test coverage — bats smoke tests for 20+ scripts. BUG-A08 fake-pass test audit — 22 tests corrected. Pre-release Batch 0: 6 standards promoted from Trial to Adopt (DEC-021/025/031/035/038/040). Total standards: 106.

### Added
- **`translation-lifecycle-standards`** (Trial, expires 2026-10-20): New UDS standard codifying MISSING vs OUTDATED distinction, semver-aware severity classification (MISSING/MAJOR = release blocker, MINOR/PATCH = advisory), automation integration (pre-commit hook, release gate, bump-version integration). Source: BUG-A06 post-mortem.
- **`.githooks/pre-commit`** + **`scripts/install-hooks.sh`**: Commit-time reminder when `core/*.md` files are staged; shows OUTDATED warnings without blocking commits. Activate via `./scripts/install-hooks.sh`.
- **32 zh-TW and zh-CN translations** (BUG-A06): All core standards now have complete zh-TW and zh-CN translations including: `circuit-breaker`, `token-budget`, `dual-phase-output`, `failure-source-taxonomy`, `immutability-first`, `security-decision`, `capability-declaration`, `recovery-recipe-registry`, `retry-standards`, `health-check-standards`, `timeout-standards`, `skill-standard-alignment-check`, `standard-admission-criteria`, `standard-lifecycle-management`, `packaging-standards`, `frontend-design-standards`, `translation-lifecycle-standards`, and others.
- **bats smoke tests** (BUG-A07): `tests/scripts/` — smoke tests for 20+ shell scripts covering `check-translation-sync.sh`, `check-version-sync.sh`, `bump-version.sh`, `install-hooks.sh`, and others.

### Changed
- **`check-translation-sync.sh`**: Semver-aware severity — MAJOR version gap now exits 1 (release blocker); MINOR/PATCH gaps exit 0 with advisory warnings. Added `semver_diff()` function and `[MAJOR]`/`[MINOR]`/`[PATCH]` severity labels.
- **`bump-version.sh`**: Auto-runs `check-translation-sync.sh` after version files updated, providing translation health snapshot at release prep time.
- **`scripts/pre-release-check.sh`**: Updated to call `check-translation-sync.sh` as a hard gate (MISSING + MAJOR = exit 1).

### Fixed
- **zh-CN `anti-hallucination.md`** (BUG-A06): Updated from 1.5.0 → 1.5.1 — added missing "Agent Epistemic Calibration" section (Answer/Ask/Abstain framework from XSPEC-008). The section was absent in zh-CN since 2026-04-13.
- **22 fake-pass tests** (BUG-A08): Tests that passed without actually testing the correct behavior have been corrected with real assertions.

### Promoted to Adopt (Pre-release Batch 0)
- `circuit-breaker` (DEC-021): Adopted after 6-month Trial
- `token-budget` (DEC-025): Adopted after 6-month Trial
- `dual-phase-output` (DEC-031): Adopted after 6-month Trial
- `security-decision` (DEC-035): Adopted after 6-month Trial
- `immutability-first` (DEC-038): Adopted after 6-month Trial
- `failure-source-taxonomy` (DEC-040): Adopted after 6-month Trial

[5.1.0]: https://github.com/AsiaOstrich/universal-dev-standards/compare/v5.1.0-beta.7...v5.1.0

## [5.1.0-beta.7] - 2026-04-17

> **Beta Release**: DEC-043 Wave 1 — six trial-status standards covering reliability patterns and governance meta-framework.

### Added
- **Reliability pack (XSPEC-067)**: Three trial-status standards for resilience patterns.
  - `retry-standards` (`ai/standards/retry-standards.ai.yaml`, `core/retry-standards.md`): retry policy with exponential backoff, jitter, and idempotency guards.
  - `timeout-standards` (`ai/standards/timeout-standards.ai.yaml`, `core/timeout-standards.md`): layered timeout budgets (call / request / end-to-end) and propagation rules.
  - `health-check-standards` (`ai/standards/health-check-standards.ai.yaml`, `core/health-check-standards.md`): liveness / readiness / startup probe semantics.
- **Governance meta pack (XSPEC-070, Wave 1 prerequisite)**: Three trial-status standards defining how standards themselves are admitted, managed, and aligned with Skills.
  - `standard-admission-criteria`: gating criteria for new standard proposals.
  - `standard-lifecycle-management`: Trial → Stable → Deprecated → Archived transitions.
  - `skill-standard-alignment-check`: alignment audit between Skills and the standards they reference.
- All six standards follow the UDS three-way sync requirement: `.ai.yaml` (machine) + `.md` (human) + `cli/standards-registry.json` entry (+66 lines).

### Context
- Driven by **DEC-043** (UDS coverage completeness roadmap). Governance meta pack is the Wave 1 prerequisite unblocking Wave 2–4 (eight topic standard packs: SRE / CI-CD / IaC / Compliance / Reliability / Data Engineering / Product / Governance — XSPEC-063~070).
- PR: #77

[5.1.0-beta.7]: https://github.com/AsiaOstrich/universal-dev-standards/compare/v5.1.0-beta.6...v5.1.0-beta.7

## [5.1.0-beta.6] - 2026-04-13

> **Beta Release**: Bug fixes for `uds init` crash, E2E test isolation, and macOS display language detection.

### Fixed
- **`uds init --yes` crash** (`manifest-installer.js`): `contentMode: 'auto'` failed schema validation (allowed: `minimal/index/full`), causing init to crash after copying files without writing `manifest.json`. Now resolves `'auto'` to `'minimal'` before writing.
- **macOS display language ignored** (`bin/uds.js`, `config.js`, `update.js`): Three root causes prevented `uds config` display language from taking effect on English-locale macOS after upgrading from 3.5.1 to 5.1.0-beta.5. Fixed language detection priority chain and `display_language` backfill migration.
- **E2E test isolation** (`tests/utils/cli-runner.js`): Tests inherited developer's `~/.udsrc` (`zh-tw`), overriding language detection and breaking all English-output assertions. Added `HOME: TEST_HOME_DIR` isolation.
- **E2E test count assertion** (`tests/e2e/update-flow.test.js`): CLAUDE.md yaml count compared against total manifest standards including 3 non-yaml `.md` templates. Filter to `.ai.yaml` only before comparing.

### Added
- **Epistemic calibration framework** (`core/anti-hallucination.md`, XSPEC-008): Six calibration protocols — Certainty Gradient (CG), Evidence Chain (EC), Uncertainty Decomposition (UD), Boundary Awareness (BA), Calibration Feedback (CF), Meta-Uncertainty (MU).
- **`/e2e-assistant` Skill**: From BDD Gherkin scenarios, auto-generate E2E test skeletons; framework detection (Playwright/Cypress/Puppeteer); coverage gap analysis.
- **`/process-to-skill` Skill**: Process-to-Skill governance framework; 3-Times Rule; Simple/Complex/Delta decision tree.
- **`execution-history.ai.yaml`** synced with XSPEC-003-SDD schema.

- **Translation completeness check**: `check-translation-sync.sh` now detects missing skill and core standard translations (not just outdated ones)
- **40 missing translations**: Backfilled zh-TW (20 files) and zh-CN (20 files) for previously untranslated skills and core standards
- **Skill disambiguation sections**: `/methodology` vs `/dev-workflow`, `/spec` vs `/sdd`, `/coverage` vs `/ac-coverage` comparison tables
