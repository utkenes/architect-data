# bq-collect (beta)

Read-only BigQuery metadata collector. Runs in your GCP environment and produces an
auditable **bundle** — a directory of plain JSON files — that an AWS migration
specialist turns into a full lakehouse-migration assessment report on your behalf.

## What it does

- Scans BigQuery **metadata only** (schemas, partitioning, view/routine definitions,
  table sizes from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`). It never reads table data contents.
- Aggregates workload statistics (slot utilization, query counts) from
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT`.
- Collects **anonymized** query statements (all string and numeric literals are
  stripped and replaced with `?` before anything is written to disk). Disable
  entirely with `--exclude-query-text`.
- Snapshots public AWS/GCP pricing rates so the assessment is priced for your region.

## Usage

```bash
pip install bq-collect

# With Application Default Credentials:
bq-collect --gcp-project my-project --use-adc --output bundle-out/

# Or with a service-account key:
bq-collect --gcp-project my-project --credentials sa.json --output bundle-out/

# Privacy opt-out (no query text at all, only aggregated statistics):
bq-collect --gcp-project my-project --use-adc --exclude-query-text
```

Then review the JSON files in `bundle-out/bundle/` — everything is plain text — zip
the directory, and send it to your AWS contact:

```bash
zip -r bundle.zip bundle-out/bundle/
```

## Multi-region projects

The collector detects every region your datasets live in and reads workload
statistics, query statements, and storage stats from each, merging them into
one bundle. The manifest records all regions; the region holding the most
datasets anchors pricing. No extra flags needed — one run covers the project.

## Required permissions

- `roles/bigquery.metadataViewer` (or equivalent) on the project — metadata scan.
- `bigquery.jobs.listAll` — workload statistics and query statements (optional;
  collection degrades gracefully without it).
