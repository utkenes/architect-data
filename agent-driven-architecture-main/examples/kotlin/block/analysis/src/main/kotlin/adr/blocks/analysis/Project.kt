// ── blocks/analysis/project — TWO pure projections of the SAME slice ───────
// slice → view    what a human reads      (6.9, the Presenter)
// slice → lines   what the reasoner reads (G15, the third projection)
//
// BOTH are exhaustive `when`s over `Recall`'s three variants with no else arm, so
// `Recall` gets exactly the three-consumer treatment `TicketStatus` has (G12's
// pattern, proved again): adding a fourth variant breaks the build at both sites
// here plus `render` in spine/pure/context, and the compiler names each one.
//
// The property both matches exist to hold: **STALE IS NEVER PRESENTED AS FRESH, and
// "nothing published yet" is never presented as stale.** A `LastKnown` says so in
// the operator's row and in the model's prompt; `Empty` says "none published".
