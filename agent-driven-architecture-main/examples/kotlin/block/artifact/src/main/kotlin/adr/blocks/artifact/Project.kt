// ── blocks/artifact/project — TWO pure projections of the SAME slice ───────
// Note what the CONTEXT projection contributes: a COUNT, never the lines (§5.2).
// That is the whole reason a long session cannot inflate the reasoner's input by
// writing more findings.
//
// THIS BLOCK HAS NO `contextLines` AT ALL, and that measured fact is why the shared
// `Block` interface declares only `arm` and `view`. A four-role interface would have
// forced this block to fake a role it does not have, or forced the root to special-case
// it — the exact per-block special-casing the interface exists to prevent.
