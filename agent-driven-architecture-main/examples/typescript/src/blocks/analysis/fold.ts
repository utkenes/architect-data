// ── blocks/analysis/fold — the block's ARM (12.4) ──────────────────────────
// The asymmetry between the two arms IS the untrusted-recall rule, written as
// code rather than as a warning:
//
//   recallAnalysis   appends a note. EMITS NO EFFECT AT ALL. Recalled content
//                    cannot reach the relay, let alone anything irreversible.
//   publishAnalysis  appends the conclusion AND emits `PublishConclusion` — the
//                    deep tier's own signed act, from its own success branch.
