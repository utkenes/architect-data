// ── spine/pure/command — the sealed ROOT of the signed record (G12, 6.8) ────
// The base declares the three properties every Command carries, ONCE:
//
//   tool  the verb — the SAME name as its ToolResult (6.8)
//   sig   by: Actor + authority: Authority — stamped ONLY at the boundary (G1)
//   id    minted ONLY at the boundary, from the committed sequence (G9)
//
// ONE FLAT HIERARCHY. There is no `Command.Surface.*` / `Command.Domain.*`
// split, because a split would re-create a type-level place to hang a second
// tool mechanic — which is exactly the 6.8 carve-out 6.8 deletes. A presentation
// verb (`focusTicket`, `setPanel`) is a peer of `setPriority` BY CONSTRUCTION:
// there is no type to branch on, so there cannot be two mechanics.
//
// Note that variants declare `sig`, not `by: Actor` — which is why a block
// never has to name `Actor` to contribute a Command (check C4 holds with no
// exception for Command). `actorOf(cmd)` is the read path.
