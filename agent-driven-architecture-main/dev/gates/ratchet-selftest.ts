/**
 * RATCHET SELFTEST — proves the ratchet's own three clauses against synthetic corpus mutations.
 *
 * The ratchet guards every wall. Nothing guarded the ratchet, and that gap was not theoretical:
 * ratchet-3 shipped enforcing two of the three clauses it documented in its own header. It walked
 * CURRENT entries looking each up in the baseline, so a DELETED id was never examined — and paired
 * with a same-commit addition it went green while retiring a wall's coverage.
 *
 * Each case below mutates a corpus in /tmp and asserts the verdict. The tree is never touched.

// that the named wall is in the registry and still refuses; picking a vendored one is the whole
// substitution. Each entry needs a DISTINCT guarded path, and the ledger channel guards three.
