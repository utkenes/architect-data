// ── THE QUICKSTART CHECK'S LIVE HALF, ITS PAIR, AND THE WALK ──────────────
//
// Three layers, and they are not interchangeable — each catches something the
// one above it cannot:
//
//   1. THE LIVE HALF. Every path the two step lists name is resolved on disk,
//      every command is resolved to EVERY declaration that supplies it, every
//      walked fact is resolved to where the tree already says the same thing,
//      every count is compared with a MEASUREMENT rather than with other prose,
//      and the dependency closure of the copied tier is measured off the spine's
//      own imports. This is what would have caught the rot the root README
//      carried for a whole phase.
//   2. THE BLOCK/ALLOW PAIR. §15.2's bar: the pure checker is run over
//      checked-in violating inputs it must reject case by case, and a compliant
//      set it must pass in silence. Each rejection is asserted against its own
//      message, so weakening one predicate goes red on its own.
//   3. THE WALK. The layers above prove the list is CONSISTENT with the tree.
//      Only this one proves the list WORKS: the live `src/spine/` is copied into
//      a scratch tree beside the adopter template the step list describes, and
//      then THE COMMANDS STEP 6 INSTRUCTS ARE RUN — `npm run typecheck` and
//      `npm run demo`, through the template's own manifest, not the binaries
//      those scripts happen to wrap. A walk that drove `tsc` and `tsx` directly
//      proved the code compiles and left the instruction unchecked: measured,
//      the template's whole `scripts` table could be deleted and the suite
//      stayed green. `npm install` stays out — the two `@adr/*` links are built
//      by hand so the gate remains offline — and that residue is the one part
//      of step 6 this walk simulates rather than executes.
//
// WHY THE WALK IS TYPESCRIPT-ONLY, dated 2026-08-01 and scoped rather than
// forgotten: the Kotlin equivalent is a Gradle build, and driving Gradle from
// inside vitest would put a JVM toolchain and a Maven Central resolve on the
// TypeScript port's critical path. The Kotlin list's own walked facts were
// executed by hand against this tree on 2026-08-01 —
// `./gradlew :block:console:compileKotlin` after moving `Contract.kt` out of
// `:spine` (which produced the sealed-hierarchy refusal the list quotes), and
// again after appending a real fifteenth verb (which produced the `'when'
// expression must be exhaustive` line and nothing else) — and each is pinned to
// a place the LIVE TREE still says the same thing, which is the part a re-run
// would otherwise be needed for. The root README states that split rather than
// claiming both lists are re-executed, and `GATE_SPLIT` is what holds it there.

// ── THE WALK — the list is EXECUTED, not merely consistent ────────────────

// working by walking up: `valibot`, `ai` and `@valibot/to-json-schema` resolve
// from this port's install exactly as they would from an adopter's, while
// `@adr/spine` and `@adr/block-notes` resolve to the COPY through the scratch
// tree's own `node_modules` — which is what `npm install` does for a workspace
// tree, done directly so the gate stays offline.
//
// THAT SITING IS ALSO THIS LAYER'S ONE BLIND SPOT, and it is named here rather
// than discovered later: a package the copied tier needs but the adopter was
// never told to install resolves up into the port and the walk stays green.
// That hole is closed STATICALLY, by the dependency-closure rule above, which is
// derived from the live tree and does not care where the scratch tree sits.
//
// It is a SUBDIRECTORY of the port's existing `.work/`, which every census,
// ignore list and runner exclude in this port already knows by name. That is
// only safe because test/gate/exhaustiveness.test.ts now cleans up its own
// fixture directories instead of deleting `.work` wholesale — vitest runs the
// two files in parallel, and a wholesale delete would race this one.

// ── THE SAME WALK, MUTATED — the template's fifth site is COMPILER-NAMED ──

// own ownership claim cannot go stale, which is the property the port's six
// blocks got from `claims<XResult>` and which the template must not drift away
// from: it is the one copy an adopter clones.
//
// IT HAS TO BE A MATERIALISED-AND-COMPILED PROBE rather than a source read. The
// template is excluded from this port's `tsconfig`, from `eslint.config.js` and
// from `biome.json`, so nothing judges it in place; the only instrument that can
// see a type error inside it is the template's OWN `npm run typecheck`, run on a
// copy with the live spine beside it — which is exactly what step 6 instructs.
//
// THE MUTATION IS A SECOND VERB DECLARED AT ITS FOUR OTHER SITES — the result
// case and the command case in `contract.ts`, the `Verb` entry in `tools.ts`, the
// fold arm in `fold.ts` — with the claim entry DELIBERATELY OMITTED. That is the
// authoring mistake OPEN-GAPS A6 recorded. Measured before the claim was derived:
// this same mutation left `npm test` fully green and the template's own
// `npm run typecheck` at exit 0, with the verb falling through to the unclaimed
// arm at run time. It must now fail to compile, inside the block's own folder and
// nowhere else.
//
// EVERY EDIT ASSERTS ITS ANCHOR BEFORE IT WRITES, so a template that moved fails
// loudly rather than turning this proof into a silent no-op — the vacuous-fixture
// failure this repository has shipped before. The edits run INSIDE the test
// rather than in the describe body, so a legitimate change to the template
// reddens this probe alone and leaves the walk's own thirty-five assertions to
// report, correctly, that the adopter list still works.
