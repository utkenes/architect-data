/**
 * XSPEC-382 R1/R2 — skills finally compare by content.
 *
 * Every upgrade reprinted the same 55 skill rows because both sides of the diff
 * hardcoded `hash: null`: no content comparison was ever implemented.
 *
 * R1 as written proposed hashing the source directory on both sides. That was
 * refuted by measurement — installing is not a verbatim copy. A localized
 * SKILL.md gets English frontmatter merged in (brainstorm-assistant: 23,753
 * bytes of zh-TW source become 23,866 installed), the source directory is
 * chosen at runtime by locale with per-skill fallback, and subdirectories are
 * skipped. Built as specified, all 55 would have shown as CONTENT CHANGES on
 * every upgrade forever — indistinguishable from real ones, and worse than the
 * known absence of signal it replaced.
 *
 * So there is one function, `resolveSkillFiles`, that says what an install
 * would contain; the installer writes it and the planner hashes it. Verified
 * against a real installed repo: 110 files resolved byte-identical to disk,
 * 0 mismatches, and the 18 adopter-written skills correctly did not resolve.
