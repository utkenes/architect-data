// BLOCK-TEST C2 (G11) — a block names a SIBLING's transport case.
// Kotlin's sealed rule forces every transport declaration into one package,
// adr.contract (G12, in Kotlin), so the compiler will not stop this: triage can spell
// EscalationResult without importing adr.blocks.escalation at all. C2 is the
// compensation for that wart, and this fixture is the wart being exploited.
