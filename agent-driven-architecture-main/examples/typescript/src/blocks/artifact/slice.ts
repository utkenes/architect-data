// ── blocks/artifact/slice — THE ARTIFACT IS A FOLDED SLICE (G16) ───────────
// One line per fold arm. Because the content is State it re-folds, it diffs by
// value, and it is crash-recoverable for free. The regression the old shape
// could not catch — a reducer change that truncates a line while State stays
// byte-identical — is now impossible, because the line IS the State.
//
// `SealStatus` follows `TicketStatus`'s pattern: the parent declares
// `requestedBy`, so the boundary gate reads "is a seal pending, and who asked?"
// off any variant without a match, and a new variant must answer it by
// construction.
