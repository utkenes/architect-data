// ── spine/pure/view — the ViewModel root the block views compose into ──────
// The Presenter (6.9): every presentational flag is pre-decided here, in a pure
// projection of State. The surface applies flags; it never computes them.
//
// The spine's root carries only what the spine owns — the session banner and the
// per-item notices. It cannot name a block (G11), so the app's own view type is
// what stitches the block views onto this root.
