// VIOLATION: G1, fourth half — a fold arm that can CONSTRUCT the stamp.
// An arm legitimately RECEIVES a Signature (that is the whole point of the
// stamp arriving with the fold); what it may never do is BIND the constructor.
// The value import IS the forge: with it, the arm that folds an agent's tool
// result can mint a `Human` confirmation nobody performed, and no import-name
// rule on the TYPE catches it because a block fold is allowed to name the type.
