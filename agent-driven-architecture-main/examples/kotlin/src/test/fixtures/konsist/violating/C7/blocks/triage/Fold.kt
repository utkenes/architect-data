// BLOCK-TEST C7 (G1) — an ARM mints transport. Two forgeries, one file:
//
//   (a) a ToolResult manufactured here never went through the boundary's
//       name→ToolResult map — never gated, never committed as what was actually
//       folded, which is precisely the disagreement the review measured (G1);
//   (b) a Command manufactured here never crossed the bus at all. Stashed into
//       the block's own slice it re-folds deterministically on every replay and
//       renders as if a principal had confirmed something no gate ever saw —
//       the bus record stays clean while State carries the forgery.
