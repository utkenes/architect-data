|Shared|.5 Passive Optical Network
-----------------------------------------

PON (Passive Optical Network) is the technology most commonly used to
deliver fiber-based broadband to homes and businesses. PON adopts a
point-to-multipoint design, which means the network is structured as a
tree, with a single point starting in the ISP’s network and then
fanning out to reach on the order of a thousand homes. PON gets its
name from the fact that the splitters are passive: they forward
optical signals downstream and upstream without actively storing and
forwarding frames. Framing then happens at the source in the ISP’s
premises, in a device called an *Optical Line Terminal* (OLT), and at
the end-points in individual homes, in a device called an *Optical
Network Unit* (ONU).

:numref:`Figure %s <fig-pon>` shows an example PON, simplified to
depict just one ONU and one OLT. In practice, a Central Office would
include multiple OLTs connecting to thousands of customer homes. For
completeness, :numref:`Figure %s <fig-pon>` also includes a piece of
Telco equipment known as a *Broadband Network Gateway (BNG)*. As its
name implies, the BNG is effectively the gateway between the access
network (everything to the left of the BNG) and the Internet
(everything to the right of the BNG). The BNG serves much the same
role as the Mobile Core in the mobile cellular network: it manages
subscribers as they connect to the network. This includes metering
usage for billing purposes, and when necessary, throttling user
traffic according to the level of service the subscriber is paying for
(e.g., did they sign up for 1Gbps or some lesser tier). Exactly how
"throttling" is implemented is a topic we cover in Chapter |Capacity|.

Because the splitters are passive, PON has to implement some form of
multi-access protocol. The approach it adopts can be summarized as
follows. First, upstream and downstream traffic are transmitted on two
different optical wavelengths, so they are completely independent of
each other. Downstream traffic starts at the OLT and the signal is
propagated down every link in the PON. As a consequence, every frame
reaches every ONU. This device then looks at a unique identifier in the
individual frames sent over the wavelength, and either keeps the frame
(if the identifier is for it) or drops it (if not). Encryption is used
to keep ONUs from eavesdropping on their neighbors’ traffic.

Upstream traffic is then time-division multiplexed on the upstream
wavelength, with each ONU periodically getting a turn to transmit.
Because the ONUs are distributed over a fairly wide area (measured in
kilometers) and at different distances from the OLT, it is not practical
for them to transmit based on synchronized clocks. Instead,
the OLT transmits *grants* to the individual ONUs, giving them a time
interval during which they can transmit. In other words, the single OLT
is responsible for centrally implementing the round-robin sharing of the
shared PON. This includes the possibility that the OLT can grant each
ONU a different share of time, effectively implementing different levels
of service.

PON is similar to Ethernet in the sense that it defines a sharing
algorithm that has evolved over time to accommodate higher and higher
bandwidths. G-PON (Gigabit-PON) was first deployed a decade ago,
supporting a bandwidth of 2.25-Gbps per wavelength. XGS-PON (10
Gigabit-PON) is the more common deployment today, with 50G-PON on the
horizon. In each case, the bandwidth provided by a given wavelength is
shared among multiple subscribers.
