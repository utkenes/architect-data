// ── blocks/analysis/contract — the tiered relay's transport (11) ───────────
// A deep tier publishes conclusions; a fast tier recalls them. Both halves are
// ORDINARY VERBS with ordinary Command cases — the tiering lives in which
// registration list a tier is wired with (app/wire's FAST_TIER / DEEP_TIER), not in
// a second mechanic.
//
// PACKAGE NOTE (G12, in Kotlin): this file sits in blocks/analysis/ but declares package
// adr.contract, because Kotlin requires every variant of a sealed hierarchy to live
// in one package. Gate check C2 compensates.
//
// HARD CONSTRAINT (G1 + 11.3): no case declares an Actor, an Authority or a
// Signature — so A RECALLED CONCLUSION CANNOT CARRY AUTHORITY. `Recall` itself
// declares only text and publishedAt. Recall confers no permission: it is
// unrepresentable, not merely unused, which is the same bar G1 cleared.
