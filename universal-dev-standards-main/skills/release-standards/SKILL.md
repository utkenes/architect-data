  [UDS] Guide the release process — semantic versioning, release modes, and the start/finish/promote/deploy sequence.
  Use when: cutting a release, deciding a semantic version bump, promoting a release candidate to stable, recording a deployment.
  Not for: writing the changelog entries themselves — use /changelog; the deployment mechanics — use /deploy.
  Keywords: release, semantic versioning, version bump, release candidate, promote, 發布, 語意化版本, 發版流程.

status: stable
# 2026-08-18: `disable-model-invocation: true` removed, and a status recorded.
#
# The flag was applied by d415937e alongside the description rewrite and, like
# the two lifted on 2026-08-17, followed no stateable rule. These eight were
# left alone that day for a reason that was correct at the time: the rule
# settled on was "a reference is model-invocable", and none of them carried a
# `status` at all, so lifting them would have replaced one unruled state with
# one unruled action.
#
# Measured 2026-08-18, which is what closed it: all eight carry a full
# `Use when:` trigger and a `Not for:` exclusion, all eight describe an action
# rather than reference material, and all eight already have a slash command —
# which is exactly the shape of `code-review-assistant`, whose paired `/code-review`
# was ruled not to justify the flag. `journey-test-assistant` is the standing
# precedent: same "Generate X" shape, `status: stable`, never disabled.
#
# `stable` rather than a new value: `skills/` uses reference, stable and
# experimental, and inventing a fourth would be the same unruled-action mistake
# in different clothing.
#
# The cost of being wrong is asymmetric and observable in only one direction.
# Over-triggering shows up and is undone by deleting a line; a skill that is
# structurally unable to fire produces no signal at all. (XSPEC-378 R5)

# Release Assistant | 發布助手

Guide the release process following Semantic Versioning and changelog best practices.

引導遵循語義化版本和變更日誌最佳實踐的發布流程。

## Subcommands | 子命令

| Subcommand | Mode | Description | 說明 |
|------------|------|-------------|------|
| `start` | All | Start a release branch/process | 開始發布流程 |
| `finish` | CI/CD | Finalize release (tag, merge) | 完成發布（標籤、合併） |
| `promote` | Manual/Hybrid | Promote RC to Stable | RC → Stable 晉升 |
| `deploy` | Manual/Hybrid | Record deployment to environment | 記錄部署紀錄 |
| `manifest` | Manual/Hybrid | Generate build-manifest.json | 產生打包資訊清單 |
| `verify` | Manual/Hybrid | Verify manifest consistency | 驗證清單一致性 |
| `changelog` | All | Generate or update CHANGELOG.md | 產生或更新變更日誌 |
| `check` | All | Run pre-release verification | 執行發布前檢查 |

## Release Modes | 發布模式

Configure via `uds init` or `uds config --type release_mode`:

| Mode | Description | 說明 |
|------|-------------|------|
| `ci-cd` | Automatic publishing via CI/CD pipeline (default) | CI/CD 自動發布（預設） |
| `manual` | Manual packaging + RC workflow | 手動打包 + RC 工作流程 |
| `hybrid` | CI builds artifact + manual deployment | CI 建置 + 手動部署 |

## Version Types | 版本類型

| Type | Pattern | npm Tag | 用途 |
|------|---------|---------|------|
| Stable | `X.Y.Z` | `@latest` | Production release | 正式版 |
| Beta | `X.Y.Z-beta.N` | `@beta` | Public testing | 公開測試 |
| Alpha | `X.Y.Z-alpha.N` | `@alpha` | Internal testing | 內部測試 |
| RC | `X.Y.Z-rc.N` | `@rc` | Release candidate | 候選版本 |

## Workflow | 工作流程

1. **Determine version** - Decide version type based on changes (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH)
2. **Triage open issues/PRs** - `gh pr list` + `gh issue list`; classify each **bring-in vs defer** (XSPEC-265) / 掃描 issue/PR、每項二分（帶上 vs backlog）
3. **Update version files** - Update package.json and related version references
4. **Update CHANGELOG** - Move [Unreleased] entries to new version section
5. **Run pre-release checks** - Verify tests, lint, standards compliance, **and issue/PR triage gate**
6. **Create git tag** - Tag with `vX.Y.Z` format
7. **Commit and push** - Commit version bump and push tags

### Pre-release Issue/PR Triage Gate | 發版前 issue/PR triage 閘門 (XSPEC-265)

Before bumping, scan open issues/PRs and make a conscious decision per item — do **not** rely on memory:

| Class | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Bring-in** | patch dependabot PR / release-blocking bug / fix relevant to this version's theme → merge before bump |
| **Defer** | major PR, audit/enhancement issue, needs separate evaluation → record in signoff "deferred" + release-notes Known Issues |

- Confirm `cross-project/sub-project-triage.md` snapshot is recent (≤7 days); refresh if stale.
- Record the result in the release sign-off (Tier-1): `Pre-release issue/PR triage | PASS | N PRs / M issues: X merged / Y deferred`.
- **Do not require emptying the backlog** — only that every item has a conscious decision + a record. 不要求清空 backlog，只要求每項有意識決策 + 留紀錄。

### Version Increment Rules | 版本遞增規則

| Change Type | Increment | Example |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Breaking changes | MAJOR | 1.9.5 → 2.0.0 |
| New features (backward-compatible) | MINOR | 2.3.5 → 2.4.0 |
| Bug fixes (backward-compatible) | PATCH | 3.1.2 → 3.1.3 |

## Usage | 使用方式

### CI/CD Mode (default)
- `/release start 1.2.0` - Start release process for v1.2.0
- `/release changelog 1.2.0` - Update CHANGELOG for v1.2.0
- `/release finish 1.2.0` - Finalize and tag v1.2.0
- `/release check` - Run pre-release verification

### Manual Mode (RC workflow)
- `/release start 1.2.0-rc.1` - Create RC version
- `uds release manifest` - Generate build-manifest.json
- `uds release deploy staging` - Record staging deployment
- `uds release deploy staging --result passed` - Record test result
- `/release promote 1.2.0` - Promote RC to stable
- `uds release deploy production` - Record production deployment
- `uds release verify` - Verify manifest consistency

## Next Steps Guidance | 下一步引導

After `/release` completes, the AI assistant should suggest:

> **發布流程完成。建議下一步 / Release process complete. Suggested next steps:**
> - 驗證 npm 發布狀態 `npm view <pkg> dist-tags` ⭐ **Recommended / 推薦** — Verify npm publication status
> - 建立 GitHub Release 並撰寫發布說明 — Create GitHub Release with notes
> - 通知利害關係人新版本已發布 — Notify stakeholders of new release
